"PT 1 I’ve had COVID so I haven’t been able to leave my room for quite some time. I told myself I would get outside and do something today, so I went for a run/walk. I came across a graveyard, a site that is usually only visited in the context of death. I stepped in, because I was curious. The first thing that catches the eye when stumbling into this setting is the gravestones. They vary: some are fresh, some are ancient, some are littered with gifts, but the biggest difference is size. Some are the size of a paperback and some look like the Las Vegas Eiffel Tower. It’s no secret that gravestones are an industry in themselves (they cost thousands, even though they’re just engraved rocks). Why is that? Who is buying them? Assumedly, it is the deceased themselves or their nuclear families. This isn’t the only thing that costs more money than it’s worth. This falls under a category of assets in which the price you pay ultimately ties the value of the asset. What else? Wedding rings are expensive because you are putting tangible value on your partner? Luxury items are a status symbol. I would make the argument that gravestones, too, can be a status symbol. Although, it is moreso a clear attempt to root a person’s legacy in a world that rotates no differently the day you’ve left earth. I thought to myself, “what’s the point of these giant gravestones, what are we trying to prove here.” If anything, a cemetery is the most pressing and clear reminder that we are all going to the same place and there is no sanctity in materialism. I assume that if it is a purchase by a loved one, it is a presentation of love, which is honorable. If it is purchased by the deceased, is it vanity or a last run at legacy, is there something there? I use the gravestone as representative of a broader theme here. It’s clear that legacy is important to many, and it is often considered the MOST important thing. What even is legacy? Legacy is a way to tie meaning to a life lived. From Jordan Peterson, men seek purpose , and that is why they are so gravitated towards his philosophy. This is true for myself and only becomes increasingly true as we age. We tie purpose to our lives because we see the world as a utilitarian to survive and we only surround ourselves with items to serve that purpose . We use shovels, knives, and keyboards. Everything plays a role in our lives and serves a purpose . It is nearly impossible to find something in someone’s house that does NOT have a purpose . Sparing the evolutionary sense of this idea, when we ask the meaning of life, many search but do not find it. I would argue these are the only ones who are honest with themselves. The reason that it has not been found is that it does not exist. The question that we ask of life’s meaning is problematic in itself, it is layered with the dogmatic structure of the English language. Words themselves are too inflexible to approach this topic because they themselves were created to abstract meaning. Further and more importantly, the structure of the question is quite literally an attempt to tie a purpose to life itself. A better question is “what is life?” and not in some biological sense, but in an essence. Even then, I noone has an answer. PT 2 I wanted to touch on one thing again. The cemetery reminds us where we are all going, down 6 ft. That is a (literally) grounding realization. One that forces us to take a step back. It is easy to get caught up in the little missions of life, but we are all in this together. Now with that said, what is the goal? I have thought about something since our COO and I last spoke. I think the perfect leader is one that is the least agreeable inwardly, but the most agreeable outwardly. This is not a breakthrough, Machiavelli advises a prince to appear as agreeable as possible, but act otherwise. This resonates with me. I bring this up because many CEOs like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel mark low in agreeableness, but willingly sacrifice their well-being for the sake of humanity (perhaps this is a facade). I imagine it is possible that despite low agreeableness on the micro-level, these individuals are actually highly in touch with the heart of humanity - the approach is just a bit different and a bit colder."
"The Present I’m sitting in the airport. It is Monday, January 31st, and I arrived Saturday at like 7am after a 7 hour layover in Phoenix. ASU was disgusting. San Francisco was eye opening; I felt like I unlocked something, a large jigsaw piece fell into place (writing this as I’m listening to the Radiohead song). It is true that some things can’t be seen in movies or read and that they need to be experienced. On Saturday, quickly after arrival, I caught up with Calvin Works and met Lucas Oliveira at Saint Frank Coffee on Polk. I really believe that I am not built for private equity. It is brute force, which is me, but that is not a field that I want to compete in. I am too high in openness to experience and must work on the fringes, where the world is changing. Christian and I then checked out Stanford, Gates Building, then went on to return to the hotel and sleep off a tiring trip. We awoke and then tried to get into various bars. We found a place, and I had a michelada (instant heartburn). We got back and slept off a long day. Sunday, we checked out John Muir National Forest, the marina (utopia), met up with Oscar Cortes (love that guy) and spent a lot of time working on stuff. Today (Monday), I was able to speak to Michael Sun (and Walter Phillips) and Matthew Rastovac. Sadly, I wasn’t able to catch up with Juanito, such is life. Now, I sit in the airport in Phoenix and type through another layover. Reflections San Francisco was surreal in nature, beauty, and character. It really does feel like an advanced west. Californians, and Michael Sun agrees on this, Californians share in some sense of delusion (or optimism?) Many are so optimistic about the future, and I think it is because it is a city entranced with ideas, who many believe to be undeniably true. This “optimism” in the human race, I contrast, with the stark dichotomy that is conservatism, which believes in the pessimism in the human race. Conservatives structure a government to limit the central authority of a state so that the power of the people can be actualized in a marketplace with greater efficiency. I think that the It is highly honorable, but Californians only need to refer to the tenderloin to see why this may not be reality. It is this shared sense of delusion and ignorance to the facts of reality that this way of life continues. Further, this city TRULY lives, breathes, and dies tech. In a way that is actually kind of weird. This is a city where every industrious nerd from high school seems to end up, in a shared pursuit of changing the world. It is a direct contrast to the city of industrious traditionalists that is New York. I’m not sure where I belong, but it seems like a more meaningful deal to build something in SF given my overweight interest in autonomy and openness to experience. I just don’t know how one can get a foothold in this city, especially as a finance bro? All in all, San Francisco, I will return for you, I just don’t know when. I see value in checking out New York, breathing in the electricity, meeting other amazing finance people, and paying off student loans."

If we start seeing decreased cost of R&D/commercialization, there will be an explosion of academics turning into founders and more startups in biotech. The example used is a company in the YC batch that runs all of its clinical trials in the cloud and is fully remote. Rather than company creation models dominating the space, we may start to see more founder led ventures. I have a general macro thesis that there will be a lot more startup founders in the years to come, and that biotech is one of the areas that will come to rise. We saw it in software, because anyone can learn to code in 6 months and build an app with operating leverage to scale to millions. That isn’t the case for biotech due to a variety of headwinds that I am hoping change in our lifetime: FDA and Eroom’s law (see image), the need for domain expertise and the difficulty of acquiring it, IP, university institutionalized research and the replicability crisis, etc. The FDA continues to increase the barrier of entry to company formation in biotech as innovation gets easier. My hope is Moore’s law (semiconductors doubling every two years) overtakes Eroom’s law (cost doubling every 9 years) as … “biotech goes from analog to digital.” Robert Nelsen’s comparison to the rise of Moore’s law when computers started employing the current signal transmission mechanism. A part of a second macro thesis that AI and computation will bleed into every area of our world. “Today, early stage biotech funding is dominated by the “venture creation model”. In the venture creation model, the VC firm creates the company. They have an initial idea and put together a team of favored executives, often from their pool of entrepreneurs-in-residence, to run it. The startup is typically incubated out of the VC’s offices. The VC invests a large amount of money upfront and takes a controlling ownership stake. Just as VC-incubated tech companies made sense when tech companies were expensive to start, this model made sense when the cost to start a biotech company was high. Until recently, no one could get anything done before a VC wrote a $10M check, so this was the only way to get started. But that’s no longer the case. Just like new infrastructure brought down the cost to start a tech company, new infrastructure has brought down the cost of doing biology dramatically. Today, founders can make real progress proving a concept for a biotech company for much less, often as little as $100K. There are low cost CROs that will do scientific work for a fee. Companies like Science Exchange make access to CROs and scientific supplies instantaneous and cost effective to small companies. It’s easy to rent fully equipped lab space by the bench, and there are companies to help you stock it. Affordable lab robots from companies like OpenTrons make it possible to automate batch experiments, and computational drug discovery from companies like Atomwise allows some experiments to be done completely in silico. Companies like Cognition IP are bringing down the cost of filing patents, and companies like Enzyme are streamlining FDA submission.” Gene therapy has had its difficulties, and one of those well-known is the difficulty of delivery. LNPs, AAV, etc all have their challenges. Feng Zhang, Ph.D. who drive the application of CRISPR in mammalian systems out of MIT, tapped an Alnylam exec to launch Aera, with the hopes of developing a new protein-based delivery method. Backed by ARCH, Lux, and GV. If the $193 mm check size is any indication, the company may be onto something. In connection with my first Y Combinator point, the venture launched not long after launched with a similar purpose, both collectively raising $850 million. The funds both act as a microcosm to me that (1; Curie) there will be an increased focus on helping founders like YC and (2; Dimension) that we are entering the digital age of biotech looking to invest in computational startups. I think probably first, Pharma became outdated and turned into a late-stage VC (money provider) essentially as they struggled to innovate, then the RA Capital model developed which took advantage of the massive opportunity in untapped university technology ready to be commercialized across the “valley of death” transition through clinical trials. Essentially offering company formation advisory, forming teams around the asset, and the infusion of cash to get them necessary runway. The final stage will probably look something like a Y Combinator, which seems to be the best seed venture model ever created, and is where Curie.bio is headed. Robert Nelsen ( ) I don’t remember, just really like Nelsen as a guide point. He’s an outsider and thinks bigger than people who have been in the industry long enough to become numb to Medicine’s systemic stagnation. Now researchers suggest it may be driving Alzheimer's disease. An ancient human foraging instinct, fueled by fructose production in the brain, may hold clues to the development and possible treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), according to researchers at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. In this research, it seems scientists are thinking that there is the potential that prolonged exposure to Fructose basically eliminates the “fasted” state and the body can become adjusted to a state of abundance and the “survival state gets stuck in the ‘on’ position.” Doesn’t seem super fleshed out but I’ve heard the link between intermittent fasting and AD before. “A study found that if you keep laboratory rats on fructose long enough, they get tau and amyloid beta proteins in the brain, the same proteins seen in Alzheimer’s disease,” Johnson said. “You can find high fructose levels in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s as well.” Amyloid proteins are the same proteins that most of the companies that come across our desk and large anticipated drugs in AD are attempting to remove Amyloid like Aducanumab. The fact that I don’t eat lunch is odd, most of my friends think so. But it is based in work out of David Sinclair’s lab on the Disposable Soma Theory of Aging, that essentially theorizes that the body has a tradeoff of repair and growth, and that the body wasn’t meant to have an abundance of food. In a fasted state, the body will engage in autophagy and clear up defective cells. [NOTE] When I was younger, I was “interested” in lots of types of innovation/tech. But I could never find a good source for anything and biotech specifically. Since coming into the job, I’ve been able to find a couple sources. Most of the information I gather in general comes from: – Y Combinator Forum for interesting things. Nerdy people tend to be interested in this website so cool things pop up, although it’s less often biotech and more software / startups oriented. Fierce Biotech WSJ Equity research primers - Now that I’m starting to actually understand what I’m doing and the industry, these sources are interesting in going deeper into some companies’ technology When you say send something that is the most interesting to me, that’s somewhat of a hard thing to unpack, and I think about why things interest me? Generally, the things that are interesting to me are those that teach me something, genuinely important news in an ongoing trend, or those that give some sort of signal into what the future holds--I don’t usually care about anything known. The problem with interesting things is they usually have a very dim signal. Lots of people talk about how they heard of bitcoin and the internet in their nascency and kick themselves for not investing, but it would have been difficult to determine how large those things would have been. You brought up Josh Wolfe yesterday, and I watched on him last night. He put it into words well: he reads broadly across news and journals like and (may try to add these to my sources) and tries to pick up on dim signals. That’s what I’m going to start trying to do.

"DNA Storage as another option for data storage. What struck me about this article was the duration—half life of 1000 years for the storage of DNA in hydrogels… very significant. Binary is obviously a series of 1s and 0s and as a result requires longer strings of machine code to store information. The draw of quantum computing is that it is no longer n^2 for processing speed, but that it can be n^amount of cubits (I think?). I can see this absolutely being the case in DNA. A chain of amino acids acting as a storage device, if proven plausible, could be a more effective form of storing machine information. “We were able to achieve a high DNA data density of 7.0 × 109 gigabytes per gram using a hydrogel-based system.” It is clear that contemporary computer science has a lot to learn from the complexity of nature. Maybe we can use computers to help bridge us to a future using our own nature as emerging technology. Mapping the pangenome: where the human genome project mapped the genome of a single person, this pangenome project maps it in 47 people, which supports the quest to pin down genetic diversity and the impact certain genes have on phenotypes. This is a signal for something significant. Since mapping the genome is vital, and it is an area of medicine that’s innovative feats match moore’s law and less of Eroom’s law, combined with the fact that biotech is going from analog to digital, this data collection will be vital in scientists’ transition to a data driven biotechnology revolution. In order to do this, we need a high fidelity, database of phenotypes and genotypes. This is a signal of what we could see in the years to come of exponential improvement. Gene therapy for regeneration of hair that aids in hearing Ants changed by a single genetic mutation: a “supergene”. What is a supergene? Is it more stable and heritable? How can we produce our own supergenes in vitro and deploy in vivo? Can we bracket out genes into supergenes and essentially keep them as a unit? supergenes in the ants determine the social organization of colonies. This may tie into the research of Michael Levin, Ph.D. on the connection of xenobots. How can you make the collective act in unison? No, in case you were wondering, you cannot virtually screen a billion compounds overnight. Allow me to , who knows what he's talking about in this area. Virtual screening can be quite useful, but the larger and more useful it gets, the less trivial it becomes. A specific problem is the generation of false positives, which can eat you alive.

"Last week, I was featured in the podcast, Innovations @ Research Park ( ). This week, I listened to it; it’s true that hearing your own voice is pretty cringeworthy. The interviewer, Tanmay Shah, recalled that I had said “business is a mindset” in a prior interview. I don’t remember saying that, but it’s actually a great insight. Business is a mindset, it is a process, and it is the journey. It is the process of going from A—>B. As someone who just graduated from the University of Illinois with a degree in business, I believe my degree to be a waste. None of the things that you learn in a classroom equate to doing business. The reason for that of course is because you are trained to be the employee, not the employer. Not to say I didn’t expect this prior to University. Getting a degree is just what you do as a clone of the Chicago suburbs–it’s an insurance policy against being a failure in the eyes of society. I knew this then, and I know it now. I chose to get a degree that would get me through the process while allowing me to explore my interests. Ultimately, I chose business because I’m not that smart, but I know that I’ve always been the hardest worker in the room. Business seemed straightforward, meritocratic, and a brute-forced path to success. I don’t think my assumptions were too far off. I believe business == execution . While founding Y Combinator, Paul Graham wrote in an essay titled Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas ( ), “There is no such thing as ‘business.’ There's selling, promotion, figuring out what people want, deciding how much to charge, customer support, paying your bills, getting customers to pay you, getting incorporated, raising money, and so on.” As long as you are above a decent threshold of intelligence, these shouldn’t be intellectually straining. But they need to be done well and quickly to execute. A business can be thought of as a product that consumers “hire” to solve a problem they experience. First, a business needs to find the problem by speaking with prospective customers and finding their pain points. Second, you create a product. Third, you sell it to the customers. The more I work on my business, the more I understand how simple the process is in theory and how we sometimes trip over the details. Often, any person can do all three of the above. Sometimes, you need a technical co-founder to engineer the product. I’m grateful for Josh for this reason. Steve Jobs was not technical, but he drove the product. At this point, Elon Musk isn’t solving small engineering problems, but he is driving the product. When driving the product, you are essentially engineering the future. You look at the world that should exist and execute on a vision to actualize that world. Steve was a visionary, he didn’t get caught up in the minutiae of engineering. He developed products that users loved and had engineers back into solving problems to make those products a reality. Through advancements in science and technology, we should assume many problems are solvable. Often, the bottleneck isn’t in the limitations of worldly physics, but rather the lack of talented engineers working to solve that problem. Steve is also famous for saying, “Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact. And that is everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it-you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.” If you truly absorb the reality that the ends are not only possible but inevitable, it is just a matter of mapping out the means. The means in this case is the plan of execution. Google’s current mission statement is “to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.” The software engineering is just the back-end process to create this abstract solution for users to access information. That isn’t to say it is easy to execute, it isn’t. To be honest, I don’t feel like I’ve learned enough to write about execution in its entirety. What I will say is that the person working 80 hours is working 2x more than the person working 40 hours. I think they’ll get at least 2x as much done. Startups often execute better than big companies. The reason for this? They are nimble, quick, and good startups evade convention. A question that Sam Altman developed is, “tell me about something that you’ve hacked to your advantage?” (social hacking, not cybercriminal hacking). I think this is also a good heuristic for a founder. The reason is that you have to be so scrappy. There is no simple route. As I recall from my last post, , it is often a shuffle and step function to reach the next milestone. Often, you just have to figure out a way to point B even if it doesn’t exist. You have to make it exist. This year, I’ve had remorse that I didn’t study computer science, as it would have given me the tools to solve these problems and build these products. It still would have been more helpful than a business degree, but now I see a lot of value in philosophy. If you understand the bigger picture, you can reverse engineer that vision. Reading would probably be pretty helpful for that as well. I think that’s why a lot of successful tech entrepreneurs read science fiction in their youth. It opened their eyes to amazing things that can be built. Then, they grew up and built them."
"△ “There is a concatenation of events in this best of all possible worlds: for if you had not been kicked out of a magnificent castle for love of Miss Cunegonde: if you had not been put into the Inquisition: if you had not walked over America: if you had not stabbed the Baron: if you had not lost all your sheep from the fine country of El Dorado: you would not be here eating preserved citrons and pistachio-nuts.” “All that is very well,” answered Candide, “but let us cultivate our garden.” ~ Candide, Voltaire In the passage, the speaker is suggesting that all of Candide's tragedies were necessary for him to be where he is today, a way of saying that all the events Candide experienced (good or bad) were part of a grand, beneficial plan. On the same plane, in our lives, we can only connect the dots looking backwards. Our fortunes and misfortunes are the gifts and scars of life, and each experience shapes who we are and who we become. While thinking about these things is helpful to plan, I’ve learned we should not over-index on solving for massive abstract hypothetical problems or getting caught up uncovering universal truths. Sometimes all we can do is “cultivate our garden,” focus, grow , △ right here, right now. I’ve provided my personal manual for how to achieve this at the end. Now, with that said, let’s solve some massive abstract hypothetical problems → Introduction Writing has become a central and effective tool I’ve adopted over the past two years in navigating my life. It is a way to organize thoughts and forces you to think deeply about assumptions you take as truths. It is also clear to me that sometimes the thing that really matters is knowing which question to ask. In this piece of writing, I summarize essays I’ve written across 2022-2023. From the themes of each essay as individual data points, I connect the dots backwards into a narrative that has become my life philosophy. This writing is summed up into: 1) the importance of a personal belief system 2) growing based on your personal belief system 3) my pragmatic plan to △ . What is striking when reflecting upon my views as they have evolved over time is how much they can be tracked to specific instances and experiences I have had in my life, like an asteroid collecting scars and dents via collisions with other objects. In many ways, the human neural net is a loss function that adjusts to our environment and the information we consume, so we should be purposeful about what we ingest. The clearest learnings have been from direct experience absorbing a problem, carrying its burden, chewing on potential solutions for an extended period of time, and finally arriving at my own beliefs from first principles. Humans learn by doing. I’ve also created two new symbols, because I don’t like the current symbols we use for (1) “meaning / purpose” and (2) “growth, expansion of the self, overcoming, and will to power.” The first set of words are a false symbol and overdetermined, there are no meanings, there just “is” the current state of the world. I think the second set of words are extremely important, because in many ways they are poorly contrived symbols to capture what is the most important theme of this philosophy and what I believe to be the “meaning of life.” 1. Λόγος (The Logos) - “A principle originating in classical Greek thought which refers to a universal divine reason, immanent in nature, yet transcending all oppositions and imperfections in the cosmos and humanity.” I originally read this term in Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations and prefer to think of it simply as the current rational and logical state of the universe as a backdrop, and our own personal philosophies that spring from it. 2. △ - The hollowed out triangle replaces and combines growth, expansion of the self, irreverence towards current systems, and the requisite focus and suffering. It is also a very important symbol that I’ve thought about for the last decade. It was something that I’ve always known, but couldn’t quite articulate until now. Notably also the symbol for delta or change. And the symbol for Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, sacrificing for the sake of achieving self-actualization. How do you pronounce this, you ask? That’s for you to determine. The Logos I address the plugs we use in our society to provide humans with an answer to a question that doesn’t exist. “What is the meaning of life?” Or rather “What is life?” Often these plugs come in the form of religion or another proxy. In reality, there is only The Logos . In the same way that people defer to a political party in the place of having their own nuanced views, we defer to these preexisting moral manuals. It is difficult to create meaning and defined behaviors out of an infinite universe of entropy. But we can. And if we can, we should. The first step is to recognize that the existing competing systems are imperfect and set forth by other irrational humans no different than yourself, and that they change over time. You first recognize this so that you can begin to forge your own path and shine a light so bright that the existing systems must recognize it and adopt it. This is how someone shapes the world. There have been millions of systems that have come and gone. The systems that overtake and persist are the systems that △ , which is an important point. In order for you to create meaning, you need to step back and analyze the world from first principles. What is right in the world? What is wrong in the world? What is life? When you understand what life is, you can begin to formulate an ideology on how to live it. How to live life is inherently unique to you. If you reject the existing system but don’t create your own belief system, you are in no-man’s land. You are a moth without a light. You are a pilot without a map. I will here reference the old chess adage that “a bad plan is better than no plan.” This is the most important point so far. Most people don’t have belief systems and wander through life in a random walk. It is difficult to create your own belief system. But if you don’t, you are living your life on other people’s terms. More importantly, if you don’t have a defined target, you will obviously never hit it. There is also a lot of meaning and leverage in having your own belief system. There is more meaning in things that would not get done “but for” you. You don’t want to be the awkward 3rd person carrying a table. In today’s world where everyone wants the same thing, the competition is simply too fierce to leave you any scraps–you don’t want to be 3rd runner up, you should be the best in the world. Your differences are assets that provide leverage, they are not a liability. △ Now that you have developed a personal belief system unique to you and understand that the world is malleable, you can create a plan to exert work and allocate resources over time to △ in accordance with your philosophy and actualize your beliefs . Many people say that you should do what you are passionate about or what you are interested in. Some people speak of interests as if they are just something random that you were born with. Others speak of interests as if they don’t exist and all that exists is discipline and doing the right thing when you should. These were both frustrating responses to me. What am I interested in and why? I don’t feel like I was arbitrarily assigned with an interest at birth, do you? I contend that interests are not random and are fungibly formed and exchanged as a mechanism for humans to △. Your interests help you solve problems you have or help you understand some form of characterological development unique to you and dependent on your understanding of The Logos . As your perspective changes, so too might your interests. This is why you should first have clear beliefs of your Logos, because it influences interests. In the world we live in today, we are rewarded and punished for our interests in relation to current moral structures and how incentives are outlined. Artists aren’t rewarded as the capitalists are. These moral structures aren’t purposeful and there’s no big man behind the curtain pulling the strings. They are emergent properties of systems that persist. The systems that persist are those that are evolutionarily adapted to △. In some ways, these systems present themselves as obstacles to be surmounted or impenetrable walls equivalent to laws of physics. You need to straddle the line on how you can grow in the world you have been dealt. It is notable that the primary lever of change in modern society has become growth and innovation. Money runs the world and technology changes it. In a world that 1) the meaning of life is to △ in accordance with The Logos and 2) the current systems that exist are the hand we’ve been dealt, I contend that the meaning of life is to △ at the fastest rate you can within the system . In many ways, the meaning of life is to △ Pragmatic Steps to accomplish this and my personal angle The overarching theme is also that the world is one of nuance. There are no right answers to many of life’s questions. But at the same time, humans need heuristics to organize the world and defer to daily behaviors. While very few truths are absolute, I have begun forming a game plan and a set of principles that I use for tackling daily challenges and decisions. With this plan, we straddle the line between creativity and execution, life as a compounding step function, iteration and improvement, abstraction vs first principles, resource scarcity, the societal equivalent of the laws of physics, and the variable of time. Essays Some of these essays ask questions, some of them answer questions, some of them simply plant the seed for questions that are answered later, but that is equally important. At this time in my life, I had COVID and went for a walk in the nearby graveyard in Champaign. This essay introduced the question, “what is the meaning of life?” and how the question itself is flawed. Humans tie too much value to symbols and words that are an abstracted meaning of purpose. Nothing has purpose. We just live in relation to objects whose purpose is seen in the context of our lives. A shovel serves us the purpose of digging, but a better question is “what is a shovel?” or “what is life?” which I revisit in a later essay titled conspicuously “what is life?” The theme of this essay reveals that life is meaningless. At this time, I was in Palo Alto networking and conducting customer discovery for Nephra. I took focused time to explore Silicon Valley to understand what role it may play in my life. What I had realized at this time is that New York City is brute force and pessimistic. San Francisco is creative and optimistic. I had always considered myself to be someone who was not smart enough to arrive at genius novel solutions. Around this time period, I realized that, yes, I am stupid, but so is everyone else. Grit overrides intelligence. I also came away from this time period with an understanding that there truly are too different states of mind. One which is focused on execution and one on creation. The executing mind is one that is heads down and less aware of its surroundings, but accomplishes more. The creative mind is a wandering state and forms new connections and learns. I took away from this experience the ideal to be in a form of a superposition. You need to work hard to succeed. But you can’t work hard at just anything. You need enough creativity to work on the right thing and get to the right cliff of a step function. You need grit. You need leverage. You need both. The theme of this essay revealed the leverage in being different, and also working hard. This essay served as a time capsule of an email I sent to the Nephra team at the time where we had just finished competing in Cozad, the University of Illinois’ big startup competition. It’s not to say that this specific email marked a grand realization, but in this time period, I did come to understand that the world is bottlenecked by engineering. What this means to me today is that ideas are much less important than the energy required to turn something into reality. What matters is having people who build the damn thing, which requires knowing how to build it, and having the resources to build it. I learned that the world is malleable. I learned that because I could see a problem glaring at me in the face that not everyone else saw and took time and effort to uncover, but also that many ideas have many teams working on them at any point in time–another reason that execution matters more than ideas. I learned a bit about how to lead teams. I learned that it is one thing to get people on board. I learned that it is an entirely different thing to get them inspired, motivated, and maintain momentum. I learned that people need to work in person (I still don’t believe in remote work for startups). I learned that human beings only have so much RAM and need to focus on one thing. I learned to believe in myself. What did I know about biotech? I still won 2nd place in Cozad. I learned to accept ambiguity as what it is. When you know what you’re doing, have confidence. When you don’t know what you are doing, have faith. The theme of this essay revealed the the world is malleable, and that you can shape it. I started to uncover the importance of human focus and the inefficient allocation of it in our world today. I spent some time on campus in our beautiful 101 E Armory toiling away on projects while others went home. I put pen to paper on some ideas that I knew, but didn’t quite know that I knew. I do not believe in happiness. Happiness is not a real thing, it is just your dopamine levels temporarily above your baseline. You will still be the same person tomorrow, happy or not. Similarly, suffering is not a real thing. These are both temporary human emotions. What is not temporary is how you grow as a human being. △ is the meaning of life. I also understood another important thing in this time period. Just how mimetic human beings are and how dilutive being around others is to your belief system. We forget so easily and our beliefs are fungible depending on who we are sitting next to. This is fine if everyone around you and the information you consume is correct. But humans are irrational and emotional beings. It matters that you are very certain you want to become like these individuals, because you will. The theme of this essay revealed human herd-like tendencies and reminded me of the fleeting nature of emotion. At this juncture in my life, I spent a lot of time with a religious friend who attempted to convince me of the realities of religion. I’m not going to say religion is fake with 100% certainty, but I will say it is fake with 99.9999% certainty. With that said, there is a lot we can learn from religion. What about religion is so unifying and has lasted such a test of time? The entire moral system that we know today is derived from Christianity, which became clearer when I later read the Genealogy of Morals. At this point, I also solidified my understanding that we have hit escape velocity in one area, technological progress and growth, which first started when we decided to stop killing each other, invest, and build stuff. The theme of this essay revealed religion is a plug that exists to solve the hole in human meaninglessness, and further that the moral fabric we see all around is us made up. At this time, I had been working on Nephra for roughly a year and decided to log everything that I had learned. This was an extremely meaty essay, because it was real problems I had and had carried the burden of for a year. I caveat that with the fact that often the realizations were from building the plane as I went. So it would go that I would experience some problem, face it head on, not find an answer, and sometimes find some tidbit of information that patched it, which was realistically the best I could do at the time. An imperfect solution for some that is now hard to read. That said, there are still a lot of very real △ experiences that I had during this year surrounding the struggles of a founder and going Zero to One, before I had read the book. Entrepreneurship is the process of creating something with nothing, or more with less Startups are so ambiguous, which is not something that we are used to from the lives we’ve lived where we are always given the instruction manual. So having to be skeptical while at the same time optimistic about the path you are on without actually knowing. Trust and the importance of co-founder strengths and relationships Having “it” and the sparkle in the eye. A candidate who has a “why,” someone who knows independently why they do what they do. A surprisingly rare trait that shows agency. People who are excited and not paralyzed by an empty white board. Another summarization of the realization that the bottleneck of society is the lack of people who can actually build the damn thing. Looking back on this now, but also the inefficient allocation of skilled labor to important problems in society. The logarithmic importance of finding the right people early. Not compromising on hires. Culture is way more important than I previously thought. And you need to be a cult. People are always looking to the leader for validation and direction. You need to exercise the utmost thoughtfulness of what you say and when you say it. Don’t repeat mistakes. Learn from them. These scars become your assets and crystallized wisdom. The best way to be a great manager is to manage people that don’t need to be managed. Salary is only a way to buy a person’s time and “get them on the bus.” You then also need inspiration and clarity of vision. In order to inspire others, you can’t lose, there is no way around it. You need to be a winner. But at the same time, when you take a loss, you need to take the fall, and when you win, you need to distribute recognition to others. Momentum is incredibly important for growing companies. Never let up on the gas. A startup is like a shark, if it stops swimming, it dies. Human beings should be completely absorbed in one problem at a time and human focus is the most valuable commodity on planet earth “The Shuffle” and gatekeepers of a company. How passing them is marginal progress leading up to consecutive steps in a step function. It’s not supposed to be easy. It’s supposed to be the hardest thing you will ever do. The theme of this essay revealed practical learnings on startups In this time period, I was graduating from the University of Illinois with a degree in finance and engineering. Essentially shitting on my business degree as a waste of time. Business is just the things you need to do to go from point A → B. Businesses are just vehicles for accomplishing organized change, through △ . Lots of little things that don’t require you to be a genius but just require you to work like hell–and working like hell does not mean working hard for just 40 hours a week… Have a clear vision and back into it. The theme of this essay revealed again that business is just execution. Ideas matter less than proper execution. Looking back on this means the importance of doing the little things right and working really hard. At this time, I was working very hard in investment banking at SVB Securities. Working really hard is what initially drew me to the job, but what I realized in this time period is that it matters what you work on and that there was no leverage in the salary I was receiving in a saturated and hyper-competitive industry. I had read Meditations and was influenced slightly by Marcus Aurelius and Stoicism, which felt natural to me. I had also read Balaji’s Network State at the same time I was realizing how difficult it was to do anything in biotechnology due to its regulatory regime and barriers to entry. This essay was partly another riff on the belief that the only continued and material change in the world is growth and technological progress. As a result of my earlier learnings, I really questioned if this trodden path was the best path to △ . This was a linear path, a saturated path, a hyper-competitive path. The answer that I arrived at was that it was not in my best long-term interest. From my previous epiphanies that human focus is earth’s most valuable commodity, I had another epiphany that the world’s smartest were being shuttled through existing education programs that stifle creativity and individuality and sucked into these jobs out of college. They could be solving world hunger or nuclear fusion, but they are aligning logos on a screen. What I do believe is the only redeeming force of the education system is that at least much of it is the truth, we should adapt our neural networks to truth, otherwise we will have cracks in our foundation that will make it difficult to connect new future learnings to. At this time, I looked around at my peers to see if they had similar coming-to-God experiences. Why was I doing that job? To make money. First principles, what is money? It is a proxy. Proxy for what? Value. Do I need a lot of money? No. Do I think I could create more value in another way? Yes. All these questions stacked up into two main realizations Human focus is a horribly misallocated resource Most people don’t have belief systems or know why they do anything, they’re inherited “We work jobs we hate, to buy things we don’t need, to impress people we don’t like.”- blah blah blah Fight Club You are basing your expectations off of those around you. Why not compete inwards and aim for the best scenario possible for you individually. What would be your perfect life? What would you be doing? Most people have some sort of odd plan that involves them doing a bunch of stuff so that they can do what they want in 20 years. Why not just do it right now? Then the question becomes what am I interested in? What is highly individual to me? I also go into my belief that we should innovate upon our current government and the importance of bitcoin. But I will not get into that right now. The theme of this essay reveals that most people live a life that is not their own, and that we should determine how you should live your own life based on your interests, without answering what those interests should be. At this time, I also realized how little people around me believed they can change the systems that we are born into and view life as randomness. The first step to achieving your goals is believing that you can. When you know what you are doing, have confidence. When you don’t know what you are doing, have faith. This essay highlights the importance of believing in oneself and taking risks. People are often misguided in their approach to assessing risk. What is the risk of failure vs what is the risk of never doing anything meaningful with your life. “When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.” Basically, the last essay said that you should imagine a world where you can do whatever it is that you feel you should. This essay defines how we should actually go about that. Because other people have learned how to live a better life, you can too. If you can live a better life and not accept constraints, why wouldn’t you? The theme of this essay revealed again that the world is malleable and you can change it. It also took a stab at mapping who I am and what my interests are and continued to ask why? At this time, I was continuing research and deep learning catching up to the biotechnology industry. This essay was essentially a recap of Eroom's law and how biotech is not a realistic way for me to achieve my goals as a result of government regulation and high barriers to entry. It was a dead end and that’s fine. I recognized it and found that software may be the right way. The theme of this essay is the resistance to △ in the biotechnology industry and how it was pushing me elsewhere. At this point in time, I was going insane trying to understand the meaning of life in my shoebox NYC apartment while reading Nietzsche in the winter. Not a good combination. A revisiting of the earlier question. Breaking life down into the organic enthalpy in which we spontaneously arrived in the universe, before evolving to multicellular organisms, apes, and the person that you are today. There is no meaning in the individual carbon atoms, but we have evolved for a purpose, to live, like moths attracted to a light. We live and △ as human beings with the instincts that we were provided at birth. Yet we live in a disastrous time. Culture and technology are now rapidly progressing at a speed that outpaces our own natural selection. We can run away from these instincts, but we won’t get very far, we’re wearing genes. Should we submit to our instincts or should we conquer them? What does it mean when in order to accomplish our evolutionary goal of growth, it requires that we go against the grain of our own genetic code? We are pigs in cages on antibiotics. We have hit evolutionary escape velocity through logic and computation, which we are not built for. The theme of this essay is how we don’t have meaning at that atomic level, but we can create meaning based on human instincts. A continuation of winter laden NYC shoebox apartment Nietzsche insanity. The goal of this essay was to fully reject existing moral systems in religion and society and overcome one's own vision of the universe, their role in it, and how that role provides man with his “end” and path to fulfillment. In the previous essay, we established that humans are hardwired to expand and grow. We will dive deeper into this theme in this essay. Initially, we gave man religion to numb his meaninglessness. A moth was provided a light in the infinite darkness to fly towards. This essay explored what striving is and how we determine our values and meaning. What is our will, does it choose us, or do we have a say in this? We are provided multiple solutions on this conundrum. Schopenhauer contends that we should deny our nature. Nietzsche contends that we should embrace our nature and exercise our “will to power,” I ascribe to the latter but repurpose to the term “ △. ” We used religion as a plug before Nietzsche had his worries. He saw that in the past, we covered the meaningless with religion. The argument goes as follows: Base assumption: man, like any other animal, has no purpose. The moral systems we’ve been fed have been created by those with power to keep power. The village leader of 10 people says “No! Bad!” because a particular action erodes the glue of the system (and his power over it). Rules become laws to direct people into social conformity that is beneficial for the system. Systems live and die based on their ability to maintain order. Those that live on, pass on their genetic code in the form of morals. It is insufficient to simply recognize this lack of purpose, it is actually harmful. Nihilism unguided leads to man being lost in his world, and then to suicidal tendencies. He suffers from the void of his own meaning. The problem is the end. Why does man suffer? He will not suffer aimlessly, there must be a meaning. In fact, man invites suffering and often runs towards it. Of this era, Dostoevsky also writes, “Man is sometimes extraordinarily, passionately, in love with suffering.” Asceticism and religion provided man with a double-barreled solution to the void. First, pegging meaning to an eternal salvation not visible in this world and attainable only after this life. Daily suffering is promised to be a temporary hurdle for infinite bliss. Man submits. Second, providing man the framework for him to purposefully suffer worldly suffering for the aforementioned salvation through doctrine and scripture on how to live the good life. A “how-to” manual. It is a cheap trick. You must accept this infinite power you cannot comprehend. Suffering in this world is prescribed for infinite bliss in the afterlife. Or hell if you fall out of line! Man is backed into a corner to accept. Nietzsche closes this loop with insisting that rather than feel guilt for morals created arbitrarily, man should let his instincts take hold in his natural will to power. Not to say be primitive, but to strive, for it is neither ugly nor beautiful but man’s truth to grow. Joy is not a real feeling and not what man seeks (like I mentioned with “happiness”). Man seeks an expansion of the self, an overcoming, a will to power. Joy is only the byproduct of seeing himself grow. Religion is understandable The date is January 16, 2023, Martin Luther King Day. Walking through Greenwich looking for a coffee shop, I came across Our Lady of Pompeii church. I am catholic but abandoned my faith in my youth. I do admit that the smartest people I know are religious, so I never leave it out of the question. Curiosity dragged me through the cathedral’s wooden doors, and I was welcomed by tall dimly lit ceilings and what may have been the Halo theme song playing over the speakers. At that moment, I understood. I didn’t believe, but I understood. In an existential period where one is looking for answers, and where answers seem to only open doors to more questions, all of them with substance impossible to handle, like trying to grasp sand and it running right through your fingers or trying to capture the finity of cellular automata. But in that sublime moment, where you feel like you are seeing both the depths of history and the suffering of man embodied in the cross, accompanied by the kind, accepting, and forgiving vigil, you understand. At some point, man looking for answers becomes a mouse swimming in a jar of water. The relief comes from submitting to not knowing and giving up the pathetic effort of trying to swim. Submitting to the Bible and Christ’s open arms. Something infinitely greater than yourself. Religion provides man with his end. But I ain’t no bitch. I will not create a fake reality for peace. So I went on looking for answers. “Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.” “And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” - John 8:32 You should △ . You should become more. You should be better. You should become all that you can be. Nietzsche doesn’t necessarily believe that this should be through making money. You can be the best skateboarder. You can be the best writer. You should have ambitions and work in a particular direction. You should work on what you are interested in. This is a personal thing only unique to YOU. But even then, I questioned why people are interested in anything? What should I should be interested in? I understand that some people are interested in things for the sake of things, but I am not that way. Once again, I went looking for answers. I wrestled with this question for a long time. I’ve always felt odd that things didn’t interest me in the same way that they did other people. What is interesting about these things to these people. I have a feeling that it is not some arbitrary feeling, but a subliminal phenomenon that signals something. Often, we are interested in things that provide value to us. When Bill Gates was enthralled with the computer, he was at least partly interested because he saw its potential to change the world. Mimetic theory would say that people are interested in things that other people want. Charlie Munger says the world is not run on greed but on envy. I explore interests more in the next essay. The theme of this essay reveals how we should think about man’s search for meaning and how Nietzsche prescribes we △ . At this time in my life, Silicon Valley Bank failed while I was employed there, which was fun. I was beginning to come to terms with these questions and getting comfortable with an answer of my own. I think we are interested in things as a result of their ability to provide us value, truth, or some sort of characterological development. In some ways, life is just overcoming obstacles in the name of personal growth/expansion of the self. I saw a presentation with Ilya Sutskever, where he makes an interesting point that humans’ loss function, essentially optimizing all variables in our lives for a certain outcome, is optimized for survival genetically. I think societal norms probably recalibrate this loss function towards other things like making money in capitalism, but it is still an interesting point. I think this is an important tangent for where our interests are derived. I believe that life is not supposed to be hedonism, nor is it supposed to be ascetic sacrifice. It is to be treated like a compounding investment, where you sacrifice a lot early and reap the rewards later. What interests me? What is the root of interest? I’ve whittled away at this question for months and have been figuring out several things that make sense to me. After wrestling with this question, I genuinely believe our interests are fungible and we are interested in them because they ultimately provide us with value that enables us to △ . If I were an early human, maybe fire would interest me. If I were in Florence in the 1500s, maybe I would be drawn to astronomy and the arts. If you were interested in something that forced you to be a peasant or women wouldn’t talk to you in the time, it would probably force your hand into a different interest, unless you were such a strong believer in that ideal The theme of this essay reveals the natural basis of our interests and how they enable △ I was still in NYC at this time, probably floating around in an AirBnB in Harlem. Plotting what I wanted to do with my life and coming to the realization that leverage was getting whittled away in venture capital but was still existent in software company formation, especially with the big wave of AI oncoming. These interests primed me to make a quick jump to my current position at Shaper Capital, which I believe is well-positioned to capitalize on both. I questioned capitalism and how it forces us to live by its incentives in order to grow. How capitalism has consumed the world, and obscured the meaning of work. In our society, often the way to grow is only via the accumulation of capital, which has led to economic growth and prosperity at the detriment of personal satisfaction. My take at the end of the day is that people can reject this system, and it is well within their will to do so. In fact, Nietzsche would encourage one to reject systems that incentivize conformity. But I want to △ . If capitalism is the best (or only) game in town, I’ll play. It is clear that some people create scaled value. If you could choose between providing and capturing 1,000x that of a waitress, why would you not? Since there are people that learn to do this, it can be learned. Since it can be learned, I want to learn how to do it. The theme of this essay reveals some areas of inefficiency in the current markets and where my interests were pulling me for the prospect of △ I actually remember where I was when I wrote this. I think I was winding down my analyst stint with Leerink Partners and was sleeping on the floor of Kyle Vitale’s apartment. Then I went to a nearby coffee shop and wrote this just for something to do. This was after I had accepted my position with Shaper Capital. This essay wasn’t particularly relevant to anything at the time. It’s always better to work from first principles, but it just isn’t realistic. There is a fine line humans need to straddle for optimum results. These questions actually get infinitely complex when you break them down into cells and atoms. What is the essence of why we actually want to get rich? Why do we work? What does it mean to be a good person and whose ethical framework do we want to abide by? Is being a good person dependent on what we do in the moment or do the ends justify the means? Once again, if we were actually original in every way of life, it would be paralyzing to try to analyze everything, so we rely upon heuristics. So, when you say you want to get rich, what does that mean? Does having money allow you a lifestyle that you can live, or people you can associate with? Does it buy you your time? If you view money to buy you time, what would you do with that time? Why not just do that right now? There is a healthy balance. It’s okay to use proxies but take them with a grain of salt. I think the best way to approach these questions is to wrestle with two or more sides of the spectrum to try to arrive at the local maximum. The theme of this essay continues the discussion on the importance of nuance. Create a plan for your future. If you want to accumulate capital, you will need to add value. Do not just participate in the market, work within the constraints of time and resources to actively shape it. The first $1,000,000 is the most difficult. This was actually a much more profound essay than this description lets off. The theme of this essay reveals a mathematical modeling approach to the variable T and the importance of time accelerating the compounding of △. New Essay: The Hollow Pyramid The previous essays define The Logos and △. What follows is an extremely important point on the second meaning behind “ △ .” Once you have defined your goal and plan, you need to execute. You need to have focus. Somewhere around 14 years old, I came to a realization that I hadn’t been able to articulate over the last decade but that I think well encapsulates my philosophy that human focus is the most valuable commodity on planet earth △ I was in AP Psychology class and we were learning about Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. At this time of my life, I had learned to work very hard. The professor I had was a substitute, but she was brilliant. She expounded how human needs are met at each rung of the hierarchy (Food, Shelter, Sex, Community, etc.) and how each enables the next on the path towards self-actualization. I reject this. These rungs only lead to dopamine above baseline, which is unsustainable and fleeting. I believe self-actualization comes from △ , which requires denying comfort at each rung, staying hungry, and instead focusing on greatness and solving the problems at hand. This is not to say we should suffer for the sake of suffering, we shouldn’t, but we should prioritize △ before suffering and use discomfort as a weapon to maximize △ . Suffering and Comfort I get shit from people when I tell them that I have never felt stressed in my life, and I have certainly never felt any form of depression. I have suffered, though, and I have been focused. Suffering is the most pure lever I have ever found that amplifies focus and performance. If I had an enemy, I would similarly leverage happiness to keep them comfortable and stagnant. Humans love comfort. Comfort is distracting. Comfort and happiness are some of the most damaging emotions you can experience. You will never find the resistance that you need to sharpen you in times of comfort. I am not a materialist, material distracts from focus. I don’t care much for money, unless I can spend it increasing time and focus. Human focus is earth’s most valuable commodity. For whatever reason, I became comfortable with suffering early in life to the point where I actually do not recognize it, nor do I acknowledge happiness. It has always been the case in my life that the more difficult things have been, the more that I △ . My philosophy has unknowingly always been to reject oneself for the sake of △. Try fasting, try deleting all the apps, try really pushing yourself to the limits. Your dopamine levels will adjust to that baseline and you will be able to run through any brick wall that presents. This is also one of the most helpful ways to increase the need for growth. It pushes you to compete inwards, no matter how comfortable you may feel. Stay humble, stay hungry. The reason I couldn’t figure this out before was because it’s not like denying yourself is some magic pill for growth. Nietzsche would agree there is no sanctity in asceticism. There is, however, the ability to focus and propensity to △. Don’t suffer just to suffer. Suffer as a lever to improve performance and focus, especially for delayed gratification. Focus Throughout history, many people are often defined by even just one experience, one philosophy, one trait, one accomplishment. Focus is more important than diversification if you want to accomplish amazing things. What makes me unique? What do I believe that no one else does? What do I know that no one else does? What am I the best in the world at? You will find incredible leverage in that one thing. I believe in focus so much that I have devised a routine and written a ritual to remind myself every morning the derivation of my purpose and what that means for what I should be doing at this very moment. Humans lack focus. Especially in such a mentally stimulating time where we are distracted at every moment of every day, with shorter and shorter attention spans, I deeply believe in long-term focus at one goal. That one thing often becomes the magnum opus that a person becomes remembered for. That one thing is what I will tailor my future company's cultures towards. That one thing is what I will look for in candidates. That one thing is the rule that I will live my life by. I don’t know if you can tell yet, but I believe human focus is Earth’s most valuable commodity. For all that has gone wrong and all that has gone right: if you had not stepped foot in that cemetery: if you had not gone to California: if you had not had Quant & Nephra: if you had not discovered engineering: if you had not spent time in isolation: if you had not questioned religion: if you had not worked a dead-end job in investment banking: if you had not invested in the best performing asset of the year: if you had not forged a connection that turned out to be the relationship needed for your dream job: if you had not earned a degree in a field that was a waste of time: if you had not been trapped in a shoebox apartment during NYC’s winter: if you had not came across Our Lady of Pompeii Church and stepped in its doors: if you had not gotten rid of your belongings and floated to an AirBnB in Harlem: if you had not quit your job and slept on the floor of Kyle Vitale’s apartment: you would not be here sipping wine and eating Takis. “All that is very well, “but let us cultivate our garden” No. Let us △. Practical Principles For Company Formation - (these can be refined over time) △ - The meaning of life is to △. Everyone on board should be aligned. That is the goal of the company. That is the goal of the employees. We want people who △ fast. Focus - Human focus is the most valuable commodity on planet earth, and it is limited, humans only have so much RAM. Focus so hard it hurts, the pain will point you in the right direction. Instill a culture of growth and trust. Unleash human focus on infinite games (goals with no upper bound). Why? And Vision - A core tenant to my philosophy is having a “why.” Know what you do and why you do it and how it fits into the broader vision. Engineers solve problems. Make sure they're problems that matter. Similarly, be very purposeful with the incentives you create. Create win-win-wins. The leaders set the pace. “Having a vision is what tends to separate the leaders from the followers” - Richard Hamming. People look to you. Do not stray. Leaders set an endpoint (use this power wisely). People will look as you do, not just what you say. Be consistent. Talent - The right people matter. Hire for strengths over lack of weaknesses. Quality over quantity. The bottleneck of society is finding people that can actually build the damn thing. Co-founders matter. Trust matters. Talent Density. Get the right people and inspire them. Execution, Velocity, Momentum - Execution matters. Speed matters. Momentum matters. Momentum comes from winning and believing deeply. Business is a mindset. Everyone needs to row in the same direction, be a cult. Cut bureaucracy immediately. Culture - Culture matters. Create a place where the extremely ambitious go. Ambitious and smart people like working with other ambitious and smart people. If you create a place that is good to work, when things hit the fan (they will), people won't leave. Reserved Optimism - Learning and understanding matters. Indeterminacy (learning) vs determinacy (execution). But often the best learning comes from doing. So defer to doing. If you know what you are doing, have confidence. If you don’t know what you are doing, have faith. Startups shouldn’t look at risk the same way an investor would. Burn the boats, make it happen. First Principles - Think in first principles; question every assumption and proxy. Most things are a means to an end. Compete inward, escape outward competition. Focus on infinite games. Logic - Computers are changing the world. The world of bits is not a bad horse to hitch a ride to. Learn - Don’t make the same mistake twice. Step-Functions - Life is not linear, it is an exponentially compounding step function whose upper limit is the business equivalent of the laws of physics. If I look back on my life, each △ has been the result of a long preparation and a step-up that took longer than expected but happened quicker than I thought. Suffering - It’s not supposed to be easy. It’s supposed to be the hardest thing you’ve ever done. Suffering and happiness are both temporary emotions that you can ignore for long term △."
"Josh and I spoke today for a long period of time about religion and purpose. Josh (Jewish) wanted to prove the existence of God citing scripture from The Old Testament. He doesn’t know this, but it ironically led me to change from being an agnostic to atheist (although agnosticism is basically a cop-out/insurance policy for atheism). Josh spoke about how the world was in shambles before The Old Testament. Jews believe that the introduction of this scripture led to the organization of contemporary society as we know it. Truthfully, Christianity is based in Judaism and the laws that govern The United States are based in Christianity, so… kinda true. But one thing didn’t hit right. I argued that Native American tribes and Aztecs had no influence of G-d, yet lived in a relatively organized society. Many served their own gods, religions that did not pass the test of time as Christianity expanded–first mover advantage wasn’t enough in this case. Religion served an important purpose. Religions are like any organization of people, they provide a set of rules to act as the glue of society, just like corporate bylaws, the U.S. Constitution, and Monopoly instructions. I argue they are all the same. Early rulebooks like Hammurabi’s code provide early guidance with the “eye for an eye” principle as a way to introduce justice. However, it was soon discovered that killing a man for killing a man leads to a disastrous society and replacements came that included empathy. Man is not inherently evil, they say. He can be saved, they say. All religions serve the same purpose of prescribing that followers “do unto others as you would want done unto yourself.” This is the most important phrase of all. One day, man woke up and discovered with others that a mutual agreement to not kill each other and trade led to net mutual success. The reality is that there is no right or wrong, except for what we have been brainwashed and raised to believe. If you were raising a child, this phrase would work for most behavioral lessons. If you raised that same child in a society where people practiced hate and anger (*cough cough New York), asides from an assumed evolutionary selection for amiable genetics, they would see that as commonplace and grow up to enforce a culture of hatred and violence. This phrase is a difficult thing to enforce as soon as an authority turns their back. An omnipotent God is the clear solution to finite oversight and authority of the mortal world. A God that can see all and judges accordingly. A God with the power to send you to everlasting paradise or suffering. This was enough to scare constituents into making their bed every morning. In this sense, it is why the U.S. should be considered a religion, a strong culture of work and obedience enforced by the criminal justice system and culture where you need to work and make money to survive. It’s set up perfectly to engineer an efficient society and why it has led to great success. Communism is an organizational structure with faults in its support mechanisms. All religions face a fate of unraveling. Perhaps Christianity is seeing the beginning of that now. As there is a change in the world order, perhaps the U.S. will be seeing this fate against China. And then Bitcoin and decentralized society? And then artificial general intelligence” (the only omnipotence that can be proved in a theorem). I predict that while religion may alter its form in the centuries to come, it will persist, whether in the form of legislature, gospel, or something my brain isn’t big enough to imagine at this point in time. Assuming government technology will exist that can maintain watch on its denizens and enforce authority, then there is the potential for mass control and infinite concentration of power. This was not a possibility of the past; however, assuming infinite technological advancement, this is not just possible, but eventual in the relatively near future. *side note, if this is the case, then a decentralized future is the only solution I can think of to 1984. Maybe I should go into defi?* Or maybe I should make my own religion? Scientology was successful and it was built on an absolutely ridiculous foundation. Anyways, it’s pretty easy. All I need to do is write a long, infinitely wordy, ambiguously and flexibly interpreted book, which can be distilled into “do unto others as you would want done unto yourself.” Then I give it a God that is infinitely scary. Artificial general intelligence fits the script better than an “actual God” as it can mathematically be proven to be all-knowing, infinitely intelligent, and is generally considered to be inevitable in the near future. All men who submit will be allowed to live in riches and servitude. Those who will not, will not survive. And I’ll name it…"
"Team, I forgot that I used to send these, so I'm going to start doing it again. Workstreams are out on Slack, but we will use these for high level talking points. It was great that we were able to compete at Cozad yesterday. Regardless of the outcome, we know we have a great market opportunity and problem that needs to be solved. And it WILL be solved, but we can be the team to do it first if we push hard enough. The reward for this will without a doubt be not only saving lives but the financial freedom to continue to pursue solving whatever problems we want for the rest of our lives. We've already worked on this for so long that we are probably one of a handful of people who truly understand this problem and the opportunity, which is a huge advantage. Now we're software, we fortunately don't need as much funding as a typical med device company... for now at least. My observation from speaking with VCs has been that while they are investing in inherently riskier companies, lead investors such as Chicago Ventures are rare, which are the ones who take a chance on a newer startup that other VCs follow with in a syndicate investment. These lead investors typically need external validators, in the form of grant money/government support, Letters of Intent (since medical companies can not technically sell their product prior to clearance), gray hair, or a fully functional product. The two of this list that we can control right now are product and grant (when we get SBIR in addition to some of our other grants). This ties into an anecdote Paul Zhang cited yesterday from his Y Combinator experience that I thought was really powerful. ""Build product, and everything else follows."" Truth is we are nobody right now. No one cares that we believe in ourselves. Even if what we say is true, VCs can't take those risks with their LP's capital. The only thing that people can never ignore is a product that is objectively amazing. There's something funny about how much schools invest in student startups. Their success rates are so low. Everyone hears about the Mark Zuckerbergs but nobody sees the carcasses along the way. They are a terrible investment, and VCs see this. The reason is that we are inexperienced and our time is pulled in so many directions. The human brain only has so much RAM. But I have seen first hand the intellectual power and brute force that we are capable of when we work together in the same room--there's an energy that being separate cannot capture. This is why I love our team and believe in our vision. But this is something we don't do enough. It is my opinion that in order for this to be worth our time, we should give the upcoming month everything that we've got. If we don't make progress, then maybe this isn't our destiny. But, and we know that this tech is possible, we are able to do what we've been saying we can for so long, this can be a life changing opportunity for everyone involved and it would be a crime to not capitalize on it. I propose that we set aside time for extended in-person working sessions to supplement remote work ramping up to the summer, to which we can coordinate more later. In the meantime, think about what this would look like from your perspective. Enjoy this nice Thursday. Best, Jonathan"
"This thing all things devours: Birds, beasts, trees, flowers; Gnaws iron, bites steel; Grinds hard stones to meal; Slays king, ruins town, And beats high mountain down. Introduction Time is the single most important constraint of the universe, yet we too often forget the variable, T, in our economic models. Time is required for planning. In my current job, things have been going really well. Over the past year, much of my time went into formulating a plan for where I would like to be. Now, it feels like I’m where I want to be. The question then becomes how do I execute better right here, right now? Planning is essential. People have workout plans, moving plans, birthday plans, cooking plans. But many people don’t create plans for their lives. They should. When I played chess, there was a common adage that “a bad plan is better than no plan.” I wanted to lay out a plan for how to maximize my output and create clarity around my path forward. That was the original intent of this essay. But with every plan I wanted to create, I kept running into the constraint of time. Time is a central variable to every plan, instruction manual, etc. While I was writing notes for myself, they turned into a much longer template for this essay on time. The Past and Present In order to plan for the future, it is important to know your history and present state. Who were you? Who are you now? Can you connect the dots to project a forward looking trajectory? So I asked the question, what are my strengths, weaknesses, and individual characteristics. 5’11, 23.9178 years old, hyper-ambitious, intellectually curious, dashingly handsome… Sparing the details, I deeply believe that the person I am today can accomplish whatever I set my mind to. Set your time horizon. The median male lives ~73 years, so we can assume I’ve got another fifty in me. That’s a lot of time, and yet not much at all. Then identify in exact detail what end goal you have for 5, 10, 25, 50 years and bridge the gap between the two states through concerted effort. Interests What you do in between is what you need to do and want to do to accomplish your goals. What are my interests? Why are we interested in anything? After belaboring this question across several essays, I’ve determined that my interests lie in their ability to provide me opportunities for growth and striving. I am interested in finance & technology, because money runs the world, and technology changes it. These are also areas of leverage in capitalism, which I will get to later. In this world we were born into, money is the proxy for value and growth. Understanding the proxy isn’t perfect, I will still measure growth in money and profits. Money runs the world. Capital Accumulation Unless you are stealing, the trodden path to capital accumulation comes from providing X amount of value and capturing Y% of the value through the transaction(s). You can do this yourself directly or through the ownership of an organization, network, business, etc. that provides the value. Time as a Variable Time is extremely important in business. It is an often forgotten variable in the equation of value capture. You can build your company with many specific goals in mind. One is to purposefully engineer your company in a way to maximize velocity. Time is important for 3 reasons. One is strategic and the other two can be thought of as optimizing a variable in the capture of value: Business Strategy (strategic) Speed of execution and momentum are powerful differentiators as a business strategy in shipping new products, pivoting, capturing market share when network effects matter, etc. Travis May, CEO of Shaper Capital, says that businesses often don’t operate near the where speed trades off with quality, budget, and other constraints. “Strategy, its high-church theologians insist, is about outflanking competitors with big plays that yield long-term “rents” from a sustainable advantage. It is questionable whether this proposition is itself sustainable. Strategy involves a lot more and also a lot less. The competitive scriptures almost systematically ignore the importance of hustle and energy.” - Harvard Business Review: This is also why software has captured my attention, it is fast, and not in a “get rich quick” kind of way. Coming from the world of biotech, if it de-facto takes years to get to market and regulatory bodies punish you every step of the way with extremely high upfront R&D costs, the barriers, drag and friction to success are too high. “I think there is something about software itself that's very, very powerful. Software has these incredible economies of scale - these low marginal costs - and there is something about the world of bits as opposed to the world of atoms where you can often get very fast adoption and fast adoption is critical to capturing and taking over markets. Because even if you have a small market, if the adoption rate is too slow there'll be enough time for other people to enter that market and compete with you whereas if you have a small to midsize market and have a fast adoption rate, you can take over the market.” - Peter Thiel. Time to success is speeding up. This software-margin enabled high-velocity company blitzscaling is a large factor in how Time to market is speeding up. You used to hear war stories of the older generation about how they painstakingly built their company over a period of 50 years. That is now 5 (still painstaking) years in software. In addition to accomplishing things faster. If you put more hours in per day, you will accomplish more in aggregate, despite less being accomplished on the margin. I was never a smart kid or the best in school, but I did pretty well for myself by simply outworking the competition. For inspiration, here are also remarkable examples of people quickly accomplishing ambitious things together. You wouldn’t want to compete with these teams. . The Manhattan Project took 3 years. What if it took 10? Captured Value Per Time Unit Make more money in less time. If it takes one salesman 4 hours to source and close a customer and you cut time in half you are doubling the efficiency of your salesman. If you then allow him to run 2x the prospects in parallel, you are quadrupling the net new bookings. It is not this simple in practice, but the idea that if you multiply the amount of sales done per quarter / per annum is powerful. In Figure 1 below, this is equivalent to dividing T by 4. You are quadrupling revenue and making a leaner business per unit of time. Figure 1: To create some logic around this concept, the following formula represents the value captured per unit of time. A = Value Captured Per Time Unit X = Value Captured Y (0 -100) = Portion of Value Captured T = Time Unit Compounding Value Arrive sooner. What if we harnessed electricity 100 years earlier? What would society look like today? The majority of a company’s payoff comes after it has reached a more mature state in the future. When valuing a company, often over 70% of the company’s value comes from its terminal value in a discounted cash flow analysis. This is when it has topped out in growth, generates the most cash flows, and is expected to operate into perpetuity. X and Y are not constants. Profits increase exponentially. We should both expect and push extremely hard to increase the slope of the growth curve and value we provide as revenue scales / product becomes more useful. We should also expect margins to widen with economies of scale. By scaling a business 2x as fast, we are able to hit our terminal value in 5 years vs 10 years. Referring to Figure 2 here. Figure 2: To be honest, I haven’t taken calculus since high school, and I don’t even remember if I’m doing this correctly, but this is supposed to represent the integral and cumulative value captured over T time period. C = Cumulative Value Captured Over Time in Period Multiply your value. Imagine that the business in Figure 3 is sold at year 2.5 at a 10x revenue multiple for $50 million. If the company had arrived at year 5 sales in half the time, the company would be selling at a 10x revenue multiple for $250 million. Do not underestimate the value of compounding. Figure 3: The actual value captured over time depends on the time horizon The three forces work together. What’s more important than the principle of each of these separately is the value of the three combined. If your competitive speed allows you to gobble up market share and ship new products to expand, make 4x the revenue per salesman/year, and the speed of your business means you get 5 years of work done in a 2.5 year period, you will be so far ahead of your competition that they will never catch up to you. Figure 4 : The same principles that apply to physics apply to growing your business. You should be accelerating constantly, increasing the speed of your organization, and the distance you reach will compound over years. An even 1% increase in acceleration per year will pay massive dividends. Profit Now we understand the importance of time in compounding profit, essentially minimizing the value of variable T . Next, we should dig into how exactly to make money in each unit of time. My findings so far is that making money is easy. However, making a lot of money is hard and ROI becomes harder to find with scale. You need leverage to accomplish more than what you are able to do with your humanly time, essentially maximizing variables X and Y . The three major buckets of leverage I explore are leverage over people, assets, and financial leverage (these buckets are blurry and could probably be reworked). In each of these, there are inputs and there are outputs. Both can be thought of as aiming for a high Return on Investment. Both can also be seen as lowering inputs and increasing outputs. Both can be thought of as maximizing margins. They’re all interconnected and maybe I will even propose a new economic term for the intersection of the two one day. Leverage of People Hire people to add more time to your day. Because your time is limited, and your focus is valuable, you should pay other people money to conduct operations in your place. This shouldn’t be thought of as pure leverage. Ideally both transactors, the employer and employee benefit from the working relationship. This is a required step in scaling yourself. This could be its own essay as well. It is not possible to be the best at everything. At some point in time you will need to hire someone to accomplish something that you are simply not able to alone. At the same time, developing skills and increasing the value of your own time is important to know where to invest your time and resources. You should learn to develop these forms of trust and relationships from the beginning so that your management strategy can scale. In order for this to function, ideally employee wage < present value of profits associated with the person. Leverage of Assets If you own an asset that either stores value or generates cash flows, it has intrinsic value that is not directly tied to your time. An example would be a golden goose that lays a golden egg every day. This can also be leverage of technology to compete better. You can buy these assets at a discount to their intrinsic value, use the passive income to accumulate additional assets, create these assets with your own time, etc. This pattern is also found in the next category. Leverage of Equity You invest money in an ongoing concern/business. This can almost be thought of as a combination of 1 & 2. You are buying or building a living and breathing corporate organization that functions as a machine of moving pieces of people, networks, and assets. Labor/investment as an input and profit/desired change as an output. Each business has their own unique combination of inputs and outputs that best positions it to provide value to their customers and then secure a portion of it. Berkshire Hathaway does this through investment alone, Elon does it through company building alone. Value investment is just value arbitrage. Buying good companies at a cheap price. The alternative is to build a great company from scratch. Which should you do? I argue there is a tradeoff. Time vs Resources Tradeoff I equate the tradeoff of output relative to labor and investment in the same way that Einstein outlines The Theory of Special Relativity, which explains how energy and mass are interrelated. It outlines the formula e=mc^2, which states that energy is equivalent to mass times the speed of light squared. Similarly, it seems to me that just like a small amount of mass can produce a huge amount of energy, a small amount of time and labor (your work) can lead to a significant amount of profit, especially when multiplied by smart investment strategies (like the speed of light squared in the equation). Larger mass generally equates to higher energy. Larger starting investment equates to more profit/growth. Not a perfect analogy, especially since c is supposed to be constant. Which should you do then? Should you invest in assets and people? Should you invest in businesses? Should you create your own? It depends. If the goal of this exercise is purely profit-driven and to maximize ROI, then …. It also depends. It depends on who you are, what you have, what you know, who you know, and the current state of the world. It depends on the value of your time. Value of Time from Financial Leverage Someone who has $10,000,000 can invest that money and make $500,000/year without working. They are using leverage over their capital and taking up a low salary job would not be worthy of their time. Value of Time From Work Exerted Upon a System If you have no resources to invest, your only asset is yourself. If you are flat broke with no skills, you need to work an unskilled job and invest in yourself. Someone who has $0 in the bank has Zero financial leverage. How do they create value out of thin air? This is the problem that all us broke-ass mortals have to face. Assuming we have no other resources, the only way that they can accumulate capital is by using our time to create value in the world and capture it or to sell our time itself to a company for value we provide to them. If you have leverage over a network of people, a skill set, or some other resource, that increases the value of your time and ability to leverage these resources to earn a profit. But you will still be deriving income from other forms of leverage. Probably within this time to earnings matrix, there is a breakdown of the leverage you can get from different jobs. As a general rule, it is better to be paid in equity at a company you contribute greatly to the success of; however, lawyers don't do too poorly billing hourly. You just need to create X value and capture Y% of it. However, as a human being, you can only scale yourself so far. Unskilled hourly employee Salary Skilled Salary Commission Leading a Team Equity in the Company Efficient Markets This is probably why people say making your first $1,000,000 is always the hardest. To build yourself up from a worthless human with no skills and no network and no cash in the bank to a net worth of $1,000,000 is the early part of the growth curve and is excruciatingly painful. This is no-man’s land, because you don’t really even have access to financial leverage. The ROI on a $200,000 investment to support your life and reinvest the surplus is high. You would need to return 25% YOY to regularly bring in $50,000/year pre-tax. Even Wall Street’s best can’t squeeze much greater than the market average of 8%/year from the market. This is because the public stock market is mostly efficient. It is difficult to gain a high Return on Investment. So extracting Y% is more difficult because it is difficult to find mispricings. Warren Buffet continues to sit on a pile of cash. This is also in large part due to the scale of Berkshire Hathaway. It’s hard to find enough good deals. Warren guarantees he could return 50% if he was only investing ~$1,000,000. In fact, most markets are efficient now. Starting from the most liquid and efficient mega-cap companies downstream through private equity investors LBOs to growth equity, and the recent inundation of money into venture capital. Doug Leone of Sequoia recently said in a podcast that venture has permanently shifted from a high margin cottage industry to a low margin mainstream business. It's going through a parallel evolution that private equity/buyouts went through in the 90s/2000s. You now have ""megafund"" venture shops that are raising fund sizes on par with PE, which was unheard of a decade ago. For the last decade, mid to late stage growth equity has been where the easiest alpha was - put a bunch of money into a basket of SaaS startups at Series B/C/D, and like magic they would IPO in a few years at a 5-10x MOIC. Now it's arguably the seed stage, where all the money and deals are crowding now. VC will have its up and down cycles, but it is forever now a true institutional asset class, with tons of competition and decreasing alpha. PE in the 90s up to the early 2000s for example was much less competitive and institutional than it is today. Now it's brutally hard to build a career in buyouts, with more investors with more dry powder chasing the same deals. Still achievable of course, but the degree of difficulty and level of competition is an order of magnitude higher. Venture is undergoing the same dynamic. I don't know if it's honestly a good place to build a career anymore. It's certainly a lot harder to advance and generate returns now and going forward. Even software has become pretty efficient. Where there is a problem, there is probably a software solution. The one counter-point I have to the fact that saturated markets are harder to win is that they are the industries that often have the most capital available for capture. Find inefficient markets to capture more value. Inefficient Markets In theory, any market could be inefficient. Technology is just interesting because it can catalyze a seismic change that disrupts an efficient market. However, you can also invest based on socio-political events and the likes. It feels like while other events can change the course of humanity, they are mostly moral questions. Most markets oscillate between inefficient and efficient due to new technology. AI and crypto are going to shake things up in a similar but different way that the internet and software did. Crypto is version 2 of the techno-libertarian internet movement and the return of monetary governance to private markets. AI is software 2.0 and enables us to better work with computers. It’s almost like software went from analog to digital, only to go back to digitally enabled analog systems. I imagine this as a computer that you speak to and it understands you, rather than breaking the entire system if there is a missing 0 or 1 in the underlying machine language. AI is also much more than this. Just as there slowly became a playbook for value investing, then software, the same will occur for these technologies. Zero to One is what really enabled me to come to this realization. I believe that the last frontier for inefficient markets are the markets that do not exist yet. Technological development is accelerating and sure as hell will not stop. This is the next stage of human evolution. Not because it is morally right, but because it wins. Even when these markets are small, they are growing fast. So you need to act fast to wedge yourself in and expand. Time matters. Zero to One For this reason, Zero to One is way ahead of its time and will go down as the piece that represents this generational tectonic shift. I will not do the injustice of putting Thiel’s words in my own poor writing style. Read it if you have not. Also, you don’t necessarily need to go from 0 to 1, or 1 to 2, or 10 to 100, or 1,000,000 to n. Each of these are different opportunities and require different skill sets for different inefficiencies. What I will say is that if you are the person who owns the machine, rather than an agent of it, you can put the right resources and people in place to make the machine run optimally. I don’t know what this role in a company is, but it is what I want to do. CEO? Company Formation VCs Venture capital is going through a phase of its evolution. The biggest generalist VCs become a stamp/commodity, the few winners take all, and specialized VCs take hold as they are more skilled in their area of expertise at lead generation and investment decisions. In a lot of ways, VCs have become commoditized “money providers.” Use the to see which party provides the most value to society. The but-for test is a test commonly used in both tort law and criminal law to determine actual causation. These companies could have been started without the VCs, but could not have been started “but for” the founders . When in any startup, you quickly realize that the bottleneck of progress is just having people who actually build the damn thing. Be the person who actually builds the damn thing. Y Combinator essentially acts as a fish net/index fund/esteemed university for people who actually build the damn thing. It was essentially a realization that the engineers are the people who actually have the value to create the software companies. They are a really interesting business model that I expect to exist for a long time, similar to universities. But accelerators are passive. They help the founder to raise. However, just as a student graduates from college, they can graduate from Y Combinator. By the founder’s second company, giving up 7% of a founder’s company may no longer make sense for the YC stamp/network. Or maybe YC will forever play an important role in many companies’ formation. They also say that the best VCs have run companies in the past. So I think it could make sense that the next generation of VCs are both a founder and investor. They know their markets. They can create, lead, and invest in the next generation of organizations that will go on to “shape” ( ) those industries. Venture Studios aren’t even the right term. These are investors and operators who specialize in going from 0 to 1. Still trying to think of a better name. If you look at Founders Fund today, they are who do this. They invest in companies, but also start them if they see a problem or inefficient market that has not been solved. I wonder if we will see vertically integrated funds. Creating the company, leading its rounds, and then reinvesting its dividends across many companies at scale. What investment strategy comes before company formation and 0-1? There is nothing before 0. The only thing I can think of would be an investor like Flagship Pioneering, who forms the company after they have already incubated breakthrough science through experimentation. So engineers/scientists keep winning? This may actually be the final phase of great investment companies. Perhaps it will continually fragment. Some will win for a time, then lose, and others will take their place. The cycle of life. What I do know, however, is that technology is the infinite frontier. Until computers have replaced us, there will never be a lack of problems in society that humans can exercise their time and agency upon to solve. One of the great things that I am starting to learn is don’t be a commodity. This goes hand in hand with the idea that whatever it is you do, make sure it provides value and do it the best in the world. Do it so well that you are playing your own game and no one will ever catch up with you. Company formation is also a messy process. I think you can commoditize a founder’s playbook and do it at scale, so that the only thing left is to find new problems and continue to execute better. We have the playbook for software for the most part. It probably makes sense to begin drafting that up more explicitly. And it also probably makes sense to start drafting the playbook for starting an AI company more explicitly. The New Playbook I am yet to see what the strategy will be yet, but I expect that the strategy of these new formation VCs will differ widely depending on the firm. It will likely be like an entrepreneur with significant company formation experience doing it without having to think about raising capital. So it will be like the investment process has become commoditized and done in-house. Most traditional VCs without experience building companies will not be able to effectively run a venture studio. In order to become the type of person who would run a company formation VC well, you first need to become a strong individual contributor and learn how to build a company. You need to learn how to do it so you can do it multiple times at scale. Each will have a different culture. Each will have a different strategy. Each will be knowledgeable in its own domain. Conclusion Create a plan for your future. If you want to accumulate capital, you will need to add value. Do not just participate in the market, work within the constraints of time and resources to actively shape it."
"A cancer in Tasmanian devils that is spread from host to host by biting, something I’ve never heard of before and supposedly very rare in nature. “To investigate, Hamede and his colleagues assembled a Tasmanian devil reference genome and compared it with DNA sequenced from 78 DFT1 and 41 DFT2 tumours. The team then constructed ‘family trees’ of these tumours to track their origin and mapped their mutations to build a picture of how the diseases have evolved.” By looking at the ecology of this, you can see the cancer’s heritage and how it was passed down and eventually diverging into another tumor variant DFT2. I’m not sure how cancer cells could migrate to another host. is an example in humans.

It typically happens in the evening or nighttime hours when you're sitting or lying down. Moving eases the unpleasant feeling temporarily. Treatments for restless leg syndrome typically fall into two main categories, according to the Mayo Clinic: prescription medications—including opioids, muscle relaxants and drugs that increase dopamine levels—and external, topical treatments like warm baths, leg massages, foot wraps and more. Noctrix Health aims to bridge that gap with a neurostimulation-based approach.

"Introduction Overview Thanks for reading Engineering the Future! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. You will die with regret. The reason is you will not ask the right questions. What is the meaning of this all? Why do we do anything? Why do we work in the jobs we do? What defines us as humans? What path should we take in life? Is the world a constant state of what it should be, or are we far from the truth? We have many questions and no answers. Humans have long, yet short lives and few ever question what the purpose of it is. We can not live correctly if we don’t know why we are here. This is important not only so that we move in the right direction and interact with the world in the right way daily, but also because our experiences and actions define our end. People don’t care about the little things, we just want it to have meaning. But we don’t define meaning until it's too late. What would be the result if you played a board game without an understanding of the rules and how to win? Not only would it be an empty experience, but you would wander aimlessly throughout. Humans should not live their lives this way. People should take more time to explore what their values and end goals are. In the following essays, I will attempt to do so on a fundamental level. This is an inherently personal thing, but maybe my experiences will be a proxy of others’. The following essays (this being the second) will look at life in first principles. They will attempt to answer what life is, which direction we should live it, how we find that direction, and what that means for me. This Essay In the previous essay, we established that humans are hardwired to expand and grow. We will dive deeper into this theme in this essay. The modus operandi for humans accomplishing this is now much more logical and we have yet to adapt to our world. Maybe we are just moths flying to the light of life, but maybe we can understand ourselves more deeply. The following text will explore what striving is and how we determine our values and meaning. What is our will, does it choose us, or do we have a say in this? I don’t have the time to edit and make this good, so you’re going to have to deal with it. 1. Striving Humans need resistance. Greek mythology brought us Sisyphus, which perhaps best captures the human condition. “Left by fate with no other options, Sisyphus revolts in the only way he can—by accepting his absurd situation, joyfully shouldering his burden and making his ascent once again.” His fate can only be considered tragic because he understands it and has no hope for reprieve. At the same time, the lucidity he achieves with this understanding also places him above his fate. Albert Camus, who wrote The Myth of Sisyphus, writes, “one must imagine Sisyphus happy.” So maybe even if through exploration of purpose, we find no end, perhaps the recognition of this can actually be an overcoming in itself. Man will find a way. But what resistance should we endure/what game do we play? Should we choose it? Fast forward to other Philosophers’ takes that I have an attempted grasp of and Nietzche diverges from Schopenhauer’s ascetic ideal of denying our nature. Around the same time, Dostoevsky offers an open-ended but more embracing alternative of creating our own rules to play this game. Nietzche’s seems to be the most natural, but Dostoevsky offers more color to an otherwise black-and-white-feeling philosophy. <blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">After finishing, a summary of Nietzche’s “Genealogy of Morals”<br><br>What some consider to be his magnum opus. <a href="" 31, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script> We used religion as a plug before Nietzche had his worries. He saw that in the past, we covered the meaningless with religion. The argument goes as follows: Base assumption: man, like any other animal, has no purpose. The moral systems we’ve been fed have been created by those with power to keep power. The village leader of 10 people says “No! Bad!” because a particular action erodes the glue of the system (and his power over it). Rules become laws to direct people into social conformity that is beneficial for the system. Systems live and die based on their ability to maintain order. Those that live on, pass on their genetic code in the form of morals. It is insufficient to simply recognize this lack of purpose, it is actually harmful. Nihilism unguided leads to man being lost in his world, and then to suicidal tendencies. He suffers from the void of his own meaning. The problem is the end. Why does man suffer? He will not suffer aimlessly, there must be a meaning. In fact, man invites suffering and often runs towards it. Of this era, Dostoevsky also writes, “Man is sometimes extraordinarily, passionately, in love with suffering.” Asceticism and religion provided man with a double-barreled solution to the void. First, pegging meaning to an eternal salvation not visible in this world and attainable only after this life. Daily suffering is promised to be a temporary hurdle for infinite bliss. Man submits. Second, providing man the framework for him to purposefully suffer worldly suffering for the aforementioned salvation through doctrine and scripture on how to live the good life . A “how-to” manual. It is a cheap trick. You must accept this infinite power you cannot comprehend. Suffering in this world is prescribed for infinite bliss in the afterlife. Or hell if you fall out of line! Man is backed into a corner to accept. Nietzche closes this loop with insisting that rather than feel guilt for morals created arbitrarily, man should let his instincts take hold in his natural will to power. Not to say be primitive, but to strive, for it is neither ugly nor beautiful but man’s truth. Joy is not a real feeling and not what man seeks. Man seeks an expansion of the self, an overcoming, a will to power. Joy is only the byproduct of seeing his power increase. Religion is understandable The date is January 16, 2023, Martin Luther King Day. Walking through Greenwich looking for a coffee shop, I came across Our Lady of Pompeii church. I am catholic but abandoned my faith in my youth. I do admit that the smartest people I know are religious, so I never leave it out of the question. Curiosity dragged me through the cathedral’s wooden doors, and I was welcomed by tall dimly lit ceilings and what may have been the Halo theme song playing over the speakers. At that moment, I understood. I didn’t believe, but I understood. In an existential period where one is looking for answers, and where answers seem to only open doors to more questions, all of them with substance impossible to handle, like trying to grasp sand and it running right through your fingers or trying to capture the finity of cellular automata. But in that sublime moment, where you feel like you are seeing both the depths of history and the suffering of man embodied in the cross, accompanied by the kind, accepting, and forgiving vigil, you understand. At some point, man looking for answers becomes the previously described mouse swimming in the jar. The relief comes from submitting to not knowing and giving up the pathetic effort trying to swim. Submitting to the Bible and Christ’s open arms. Something infinitely greater than yourself. Religion provides man with his end. But I ain’t no bitch. I will never take the blue pill. So I went on looking for answers. “Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.” “And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” - John 8:32 Back to Nietzche’s will to power: what it implies Nietzche has a bad stigma, and I don’t think it’s deserved. People unacquainted with Nietzsche’s writings interpret the idea of the “will to power” crudely. But Nietzsche is not thinking only or even primarily of the motivations behind people like Napoleon or Hitler who expressly seek military and political power. In fact, he typically applies the theory subtly. Nietzsche argues that causing pain is generally less valuable than showing kindness and suggests that cruelty, because it is the inferior option, is a sign that one lacks power. I feel the term “influence” makes more sense to me than power in his writings. Humans are inherently selfish. So when Nietzche says man is doing something for another, in providing value, this is but a hidden conduit to receiving commendation, and is thus selfish. Even donating to feel good is selfish. But then again, selfish is not the right word, it is possible to do something for the self that is beneficial for others. In fact, I’m sure it is just the only way our genetic code can incentivize good behavior–through some neurotransmitter mechanism of action. There’s simply no way to wire the brain for altruism without some sort of reward. It may be possible to rewire the brain to not think this way, but this is man’s natural tendency–to increase influence. Will to power seen all around us Anyone striving for anything is exercising their will to power.Groups like effective altruism are funny with this. They want to make a lot of money, so they can use it to do the most good? You want influence. You want to change the world? You want to exert influence on it. I don’t think this influence is always bad for others. It can be good. So one does good and feels good about it. This isn’t a shame for this “good” human behavior. This is the better alternative that Nietzche mentions rather than power through inflicting suffering. This isn’t even a bad thing. You can want things selfishly that help others. Nietzche just wants us to come to terms with our human condition. Systems of old discouraged selfishness and said it was “bad” to protect each other from greed. It is only seemingly capitalism that offers a societal structure to harness this human will to power. But we should always remember there is no good and bad, only our truth, how we perceive the world’s first principles. Takeaway-work in a particular direction Striving, expansion of the self, and self-overcoming are goals that I can live with. I’ve done it all my life, albeit somewhat blindly, and that striving has brought me fulfillment. But I recognize that the striving and competition is always relative. Humans are envious. If you peg your worth to your bank account, it is going to be hard to be happy. It is likely you will never win. But the competition is also fulfilling in a sense. If you are always trying to be a better you, you actually do improve. But why is it that things have been so unclear to me lately? The answer may be very simple. Fulfillment comes from longer-term joys There is a sliding scale between Oscar Wilde’s hedonism and Jesus’s asceticism. The difference between indulging in your human pleasures and denying oneself for the sake of self-piousness. Likely something we choose for ourselves; however, people on average feel most fulfilled when they ignore short term pleasures to invest in work or suffering in the aspiration of some longer-term goal. Nietzche, buddhist, and seemingly the majority converge on taking “the middle way”-- a path that is neither extreme nor lax. Paul Graham says it well. “Here's an upper bound: Do what you love doesn't mean, do what you would like to do most this second. Even Einstein probably had moments when he wanted to have a cup of coffee, but told himself he ought to finish what he was working on first. It used to perplex me when I read about people who liked what they did so much that there was nothing they'd rather do. There didn't seem to be any sort of work I liked that much. If I had a choice of (a) spending the next hour working on something or (b) be teleported to Rome and spend the next hour wandering about, was there any sort of work I'd prefer? Honestly, no. But the fact is, almost anyone would rather, at any given moment, float about in the Carribbean, or have sex, or eat some delicious food, than work on hard problems. The rule about doing what you love assumes a certain length of time. It doesn't mean, do what will make you happiest this second, but what will make you happiest over some longer period, like a week or a month. Unproductive pleasures pall eventually. After a while you get tired of lying on the beach. If you want to stay happy, you have to do something.” What to work on? I used to work hard for the sake of working hard. Now I work to end up with a certain valuable accomplishment. My time is more valuable to me now–probably just an earned luxury. This can be self-overcoming, creating the change I want to see in the world, or any will to power really. You will need to work hard to do this well. What do we want to accomplish? This is where it starts getting individualized and personal. Money isn’t really the goal, capitalism does an imperfect job at harnessing human competitiveness. It is an imperfect proxy for value provided. If there are parallel universes where capitalism rewards artisticness, being poorly dressed, or being clumsy, those would be highly idealized traits. We could easily have different values as a society, but that is the unknown for us. As a derivation from this, we can see that people are innately interested in things that expand themselves relative to the societies in which they live, so we know that our interests aren’t always ours (*Insert Rene Girard’s Mimetic Theory). Imagine if we lived in a village of 50 people. This is a heuristic i've started to use as it clears a lot of the complexity of society and is more in line with what we’re developed for. We would likely be interested in things that helped the group, and we would really only know the cultural ideals that the group embraced. We would innovate to develop new tools that would provide higher crop yields, and would develop new warmer clothes. I think that while blurry, the things we do today are an extension of this–at least for me. I am naturally drawn to innovation not for the money’s sake (although it’s of course always at the back of your mind), but because I want to create better things for myself, which is often applicable to others–and so value is conceived. If someone offered me millions to work on something that brought me no fulfillment, I probably just wouldn’t do it. It’s not worth a wasted life to me, I can’t be bought like that. Many are the same but will only realize it after being offered the check. Some people are individual Some people are vain, while others are individual. Wall Street acts as a microcosm of capitalism, vanity, and materialist people working hard to achieve things that they only want because others do. Silicon Valley is a bit of the same, but it is closer towards individualism and creativity, with nerdy founders that don’t even care about the money at times. I’m thinking particularly of the artist, the creative, the innovator, the Nobel Prize winner who worked in a field that no one cared about, but was of great interest to the scientist for an unknown reason. These independent few often have an outsized impact on society. There are craftsmen, artisans, and the Eleanor Rigbys that work just to master their craft, “darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there.” Probably on average, these people “achieve” less material wealth in the eyes of society, because they are interested in some thing that provides less value to society. They’re disconnected! Maladapted! However, when that thing ends up being in an area that becomes the internet, bitcoin, CRISPR/Ca9, the Mac, Google, suddenly they don’t look so misguided. What interests these people - it may not be arbitrary What is interesting about these things to these people. I have a feeling that it is not some arbitrary feeling, but a subliminal phenomenon that signals something. Often, we are interested in things that provide value to us. When Bill Gates was enthralled with the computer, he was at least partly interested because he saw its potential to change the world. When I look inward, these interests of mine in network states, circular RNA, etc. usually arise because I see massive opportunity to create the world that I want to live in. These areas provide me with some signals of the future. In this sense, people are somewhat interested in their “truth.” So you have to pick up on some dim signal that people haven’t identified as a nascent big wave that’s about to change the world, but you also have to be correct about that thing. The problem is that it is highly likely you are going to be wrong, the further along the innovation curve you are (see picture). Innovators are almost always wrong, but when they’re right, they’re well-prepared to take advantage of a massive market opportunity and vice versa for the laggards. As a society, we are starting to move in the direction of innovators, there’s more things to make, exponential growth! Young people have not adjusted for this change yet and jump into boring old stagnant industries. Tech is growing. I think people would be surprised to learn how much they could accomplish if they dove into a random interest of theirs. More people should question their truth So you need to choose what is important to you. If you want to be rewarded monetarily, you will need to attune to create value for the societal machine in which we live. I also notice that this innovation curve just doesn’t interest a lot of people, but it interests me to get in early and bring forth large technological change to society. This is an extension of my ideal to work not for the sake of work, but to make sure my time is best spent to create the most outsized value. Some people are interested in things for the sake of the thing, but what I’ve noticed is that most people are interested in things mimetically. What’s interesting to me is people usually get what they want if they work for it. But people don’t take the question to think these things through. This framework really isn’t that difficult. It’s probably a function of continuously moving in the right direction. You will have a blurry outlook. Then you will gain some understanding by mulling over your problems, then determining how to get to the next leg of the step function of success, then working impossibly hard to create value according to it. Conclusion Just follow your interests and be the change you want to see in the world, it may lead to more success than all this other predefined career bullshit. But this is more difficult than this. Sometimes, you actually have to be a part of the system in order to reach your ideal of success and surrounding yourself intentionally with the right people. CONTINUED…. Why do we like things / truth In the context of the will to power and mimetic theory, we either like things because they increase our influence or because other people desire them and we fail to question the integrity of this assumption that we naturally assimilate. But I don’t think this answers everything. If people are only interested in things that increase their power, why do people like things that don’t seem to offer society or themselves any benefit? And if people only like things that others desire, then why did I join the chess team in high school? A lot of times, people are interested in things for the sake of the sake of it. Like crypto, blockchain, soccer, computers, the internet. Often, before it is clear that these things will expand to the enormous things we know today. Sometimes, these solve a genuine problem for the person. Why does circular RNA interest me? It’s not like I have any use for it. Why do we like cool shit? This is creative shit. Shit that isn’t clear has an impact on society. On the other hand, without people working on cool shit, we wouldn’t have bitcoin. We should work on cool shit. Cool shit seems to stoke my curiosity. Curiosity is a powerful force, one that I think of when I think of play and creativity, exercises we do the most when we’re young. But some people play for their entire lives. Perhaps they don’t let society structure them. I’m struggling with the symbols and words to use here. I almost think that passions and doing what you love are mischaracterizations of what brings us the most fulfillment. At the moment, I am tinkering with using the word “truth.” It is not clear to me that what people want to work on is some arbitrary thing that they were predestined to gravitate towards. Why do they gravitate towards it? Most of the time, the interest doesn’t amount to anything, but some of the time that interest was some intuitive part of your brain moving you in the correct direction–so maybe you shouldn’t question but just accept it. I assumed it was because this is something that helps them understand the world. It solves some problem in the world that may or may not be determinate. Thinking about this problem as if you were in a village of 150 people, what would interest you? Art and beauty? Engineering a pipeline that improves crop yield? Are they intertwined? Would it depend on the person? Let’s try first principles thinking, climbing each rung of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. Why do we like certain foods? Probably because our dopamine centers recognize that some tastes can be attributed to certain very important substances like sugar that improve our likelihood of survival and it rewards us for it. Once you start getting a lack of potassium, your body will start liking avocados more. Why do we like people? Well, we don’t like everyone. We don’t like people that detract from our power or assholes. Why do we like certain tools? Because they help us accomplish more and expand our scope, efficiency, and power. But here is where first principles starts to fail me. Why do we like certain activities? I’m not sure I quite have an answer for why humans may like soccer or drawing. Why do we like certain ideas? Somewhat a weird question in itself. Why do we have more positive ideas towards some other ideas? Ideas of situations or worlds where our power is greater? But what about self-sacrifice and martyrship? We assume that this is a continuation of the trend. These ideas may be our truth? I’m not sure. A funny thought experiment is why we like certain ideas of ideas. And it is somewhat a relief to express ourselves through this truth. I will revisit this, but I asked ChatGPT and this is what it said: This is actually a surprisingly enlightening answer. I don’t think it paints an entire picture, but it provides some of the scenery. It isn’t often that art is created in a vacuum. Often, art is a response to the world. The world is a puzzle with unsolved edges that is never fully-solved, but the act of trying is our human condition, and try we do. Innovation and art is an expanding fractal stain in which human consciousness takes up some space. A cartograph of the universe. Realistically, it is infinitely small, but to us such a broad and abstract thing. It’s quite beautiful. The edges are where things are changing. Learning If you imagine starting at the origin, smack dab in the middle of the above picture, it is simply not feasible to map out our current map. So learning is human’s catching up to speed so that they understand the map of what we know today, with the hope of charting new territory one day. On the edge of understanding, where things are blurry, people are solving problems and reducing complexity into abstract frameworks for the next generation to take and run with. The invention of the logic gate was a layer of abstraction necessary for ushering in computation, which was necessary for ushering in the information age, which was necessary for… and so the world moves forward. Art is the same, it is synthesizing what has been done, questioning what is possible, and raising the bar. In the below passage from “THE AESTHETICS OF SILENCE”, Susan Sontag frames the historic purpose of art. She describes it as a form of understanding ourselves. It’s seemingly a less tangible version of scientific understanding, but it is still a process of understanding through experimentation and questioning. We know that no animals do “art.” Art is likely some of the highest order processing of the human mind, a new adaptation. Creativity. A different side of the same coin of truth. Following on the promotion of the arts into ""art"" comes the leading myth [theory] about art, that of the ""absoluteness"" of the artist's activity. In its first, more unreflective version, this myth considered art as an expression of human consciousness, consciousness seeking to know itself. (The critical principles generated by this myth were fairly easily arrived at: some expressions were more complete, more ennobling, more informative, richer than others.) The later version of the myth posits a more complex, tragic relation of art to consciousness. It is this reason that I think we are all playing the same fundamental game of learning, understanding, and raising the bar through whatever modality people resonate with. Coming from a school with a lot of accounting majors, I’ve noticed that a lot of people prefer to live a life without questioning at all. I’m not sure why some people do and some people do not chase truth. Perhaps it’s genetic and behavioral as most things can be described. But it often comes down to curiosity. Are they simply other people’s desires? This is a process of accepting and rejecting ideas. What do you agree with? This is once again the scientific method. Science is objective, and art is “subjective.” I imagine that Philosophy picks up where art leaves off and science picks up where philosophy leaves off. The wall of coffee tables is closing in on me. I should live in the world for two years and just do things that I think are cool. Break down the wall of coffee tables that have me calculating what I need to do, and simply do what is right. The ubermensch prevails! You need to go back and really question everything you believe in according to your own value system. But what is my value system. It seems the peak value system may just be truth, a trend we are seeing more of in society. Necessary to configure the end first and work out how to get there. The pervasive question that cuts into everything that interests me is “how will I be rewarded for this?” I do not want to end up poor and discarded. I don’t want to be the garbage man. If I was raised in communism, I probably wouldn’t peg my goals to how I will be rewarded monetarily for them. With that said, I prefer this system. But maybe it is a better thing to disconnect from society, and live the life that you think is true. If you solve a problem that you have, others are likely to have the same. Don’t be afraid to be yourself, to ask the question in class, others who aren’t raising their hand have the same one. If people at first don’t agree with you, then take the path less traveled and shine a light so bright that they have no choice but to follow. The thing that I am very grateful for is my experience with Nephra and Quant. Through founding these organizations, I realized it didn’t seem like work. I know that there are a lot of people out there that found organizations because it’s the cool thing to do, but that’s not why I did it. If you ask people what they want to do, they will readily reply, “I want to be an entrepreneur.” If they say this, ask them “well, what is your preneur.” People associate the word “entrepreneur"" with being rich and famous. People don’t actually want to solve the problems and certainly don’t have the grit to stare failure in the eye for years on end. Breaking the mold Break the mold. The only reason you should start a company is to quite literally be the change you want to see in the world. Sometimes it is just some side project that people think is interesting, like Yahoo, Gmail, etc. Often people are just following their truth, doing something they think is cool or merely solving a problem for themselves and it turns out other people have the same problem! This is something I feel like I’ve lost lately. Between learning the correct way to format and subject an email, the world has become hidden behind a wall of coffee tables. Coffee tables that have no real substance. But they are now a part of my psyche and dig their heels into my perception of the world. This is where Peter Thiel, who has been having an increasing impact on my personal philosophy, comes into play. He was actually a student of Girard at Stanford and has often cited the impact that mimesis has had on his investment framework and the decision to invest in social networks, which seemed to be mimesis at scale. Thiel talks about how all his life he was competitively tracked from high school → Stanford → Law School → Big Law Firm (that everyone on the outside was trying to get in and everyone on the outside was trying to get out). Peter then left after 7 months and began paving his own path. The problem with competition is that it is zero-sum. So we have smart minds working on already solved problems, which I have applied information theory to. Nuance Now, I think there may be a bit of a nuance to this. Thiel doesn’t say that he would go on to change anything looking backwards. It’s hard to make that call, he would just tell himself to ask more questions on why he was doing things. That is also the point in my writing this. I am grateful for where I am and the ride so far. It is true that in our society, the way people view you and your experiences determine others’ impression of you. It is a signal that I went to the University of Illinois that I’m not a total mess-up. With that said, it is not clear that the benefit of my education was in the coursework, but in the exposure to different ideas and geographical density of smart people. It was not worth the sticker price. Thiel also talks about the idea that college may not be a consumption good, it may not be an investment, but it may be an insurance product, which makes the most sense to me as well. Go to college in order to ensure that you do not fall through the cracks of society. It would likely be impossible for me to work in investment banking if I didn’t go to school. This isn’t something I agree with, but it is an artifact of an older world that we have to deal with. College is also a structured way to learn a large body of codified knowledge, but it could be more reasonable to just take Coursera courses. I think I probably would have figured out a way to be successful if I didn’t go to college, but I can’t be sure. I think that I always saw college and the first year of work as the most important to act as a stamp on your resume that you aren’t a societal reject and as a form of validation. Mimesis definition René Girard, a philosopher from Stanford and one of the most influential thinkers of our time, founded mimetic theory. Mimesis refers to human desire, which Girard thought was not linear but the product of a mimetic process in which people imitate models who endow objects with value. Why we like things summary I already wrote about why we like things from an intrinsic point as they align with our reward system, but mimesis says something different. Mimesis says that humans don’t question things enough, and rather defer to the herd of people to determine what they want. They are probably correct, right? I will assume they are and work to get what they want. I want to remind myself that the point of this long, wandering passage is not to understand why we like soccer, but why we have any tendencies towards certain things at the odds of other things. This is important for understanding what we choose to peg our will to power to. It is important to consider whether your desires are not your own a la mimetic theory. This may be unhinging at first, until you realize that you can take a step back and rehinge your will to power in an objective “you”, “interest”, “passion”, “or truth.” Surrounding yourself with smart people in an area you believe in and then continuing to work in that area. This is also important because in a world of capitalism, the area you spend your time on may have varying market sizes. If this is truly about your “will to power,” the question must be answered whether you should purposefully have interests in ways that make money. What drove me in my youth? Well first, when we were really young, we would play. What is the evolutionary role of play? There is this convention that work and play should be separate. Every one of my interests to date, I can trace back to a play in my youth, no matter how inconsequential it seemed at the time. Play is often associated with meaninglessness, but when I play, it’s usually things that are interesting to me. I’m often learning in it. I’m often being creative. Play seems to be a form of learning. Sure there was soccer, but even that built discipline. It’s how you channel your play. Sometimes people view play as this sort of thing where your parents go, “you can’t play all day, eventually you need to work.” I’m starting to think this is a crab bucket mentality. Of course some people find ways to play and work simultaneously. Because it is possible, you should, too. It’s important to recognize that some people may actually fall into spirals of pleasure. Paul Graham puts it this way “But the fact is, almost anyone would rather, at any given moment, float about in the Carribbean, or have sex, or eat some delicious food, than work on hard problems. The rule about doing what you love assumes a certain length of time. It doesn't mean, do what will make you happiest this second, but what will make you happiest over some longer period, like a week or a month.” Unproductive pleasures pall eventually. After a while you get tired of lying on the beach. If you want to stay happy, you have to do something.” There’s even a term for this. It’s called hedonistic adaptation, and I’m sure it’s not a surprising concept to most. This is an important concept from earlier as well, actually. This is why man does not fear suffering. A man who suffers, just learns to be happy with that level of suffering. Humans overcome. Contrary to what many believe, Nietzche was not a proponent of hedonism. Nor was he a proponent of asceticism, which he saw as self destructive. Nietzsche instead advocated for a ""Dionysian"" way of life, in which one embraces their instincts, desires and passions, but in a way that leads to self-overcoming and self-creation, rather than self-destruction and self-denial. He believed that by embracing one's instincts and desires in a healthy and controlled way, one could transcend their current limitations and become a ""superman"" or ""Übermensch."" How to do what you love - Paul Graham - http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html In my youth, it’s not clear that I was mimetic, but I think that is just a product of having mental white space and neuroplasticity. Going back to the genealogy of morals here, we live in this world and accept it as it is, and it is hard to imagine that it could be very different, but it could be. It could be so radically different that it is not even possible to imagine as our imagination is subliminally built upon our understanding of the world as it is today. We are virtually all the same person, less minor differences. In our youth, we joined the herd, whether we knew it or not. Even global cultures are likely widely different to others seen throughout history. I’m not sure I agree that there are no instinctual good and evil, because motherly instinct and empathy are likely evolutionary adaptations, but it is clear why Hitler gravitated towards his writings. Naziism arose with surprisingly little questioning of its morality, despite the behavior being antithetical to religious and cultural norms. Sure, some people didn’t know about the horrors, but there are stories of crowds cheering as jews were beaten to death in the streets. Communes and cults of the past show that crazy seeds of ideas can be planted into the masses. There’s this quote by Ye that I think about a lot, “Simulation: a two-year-old jumps on a coffee table and someone says, ‘That’s a coffee table, don’t jump on that!’ So it went from being something that makes him feel like Superman, he’s got his cape on, to something where he has to think about — this person is like a family member he doesn’t like anyway — he’s two years old, he doesn’t give a shit about a coffee or a table. And he’s starting to like calculate all these things. And by the time you are 40 years old, you’ve got a wall full of coffee tables calculating you into traffic, calculating you into your career choice, calculating you into this house, townhouse that’s not quite as big as the townhouse next [to it], and it just never works. That’s the simulation that I’m talking about. That’s what I mean when I say simulation.” Artists seem to be the archetype of people who escape this psychological principle of functional fixedness. Refusing to see a hammer as just a hammer, but as first principles. It’s funny that artists see the world similarly to physicists. This is creativity, a chase of mapping out our truth. A psychological test to pry creativity out of a person is to ask them to list as many widely different things in a 20 second time period: a house, sun, love, straw. It’s harder than you would think! Artists refuse to be bogged down by conventionality. They reject it. They seek the truth in their own way. But again, it is NOT easy to be creative. You are swimming upstream. You are going to be wrong most of the time. Convention is convention for a reason, it’s consensus. But of course the herd can be wrong. Artists will be ignored, rejected, then argued with, then people will submit they’re right. People do not accept change. The natural tendency of man is to reject the artist. Sad thing really. Artists push the edge into the adjacent possible. Society rarely rewards artists, and they often just end up being martyrs. By the way, I’m not reducing artists to the classical sense of a dude throwing paint at a wall. Artists are everywhere. Startup founders are artists. Philosophers are artists. Scientists are artists. Anyone seeking the adjacent possible is an artist. Another example of how these lousy words/symbols we use in the human language do not quite capture these fundamental truths. I’m also not sure that being a successful artist is just some form of creativity, which is highly tied to IQ. Most people don’t think that artists have determination, they assume it’s natural talent. “The funny thing about determination is that after a while it starts to look like talent” - Paul Graham, a hacker and a painter. Some artists are still mimetic though. In fact, mimesis seems a necessary exercise in creating art. You need to take various concepts of convention and accept what you deem true, reject what you don’t agree with, synthesize the ingredients into something new which may be better. Humans are rarely breakthrough creative. We think we are, but no one can see the thousands of iterations that went into the singular abstraction that we now know as a lightbulb. I’ve been reading up on Hamming’s journey into computers. It’s a hidden truth that it took hundreds of years of humanity’s greatest minds just to get a machine the size of a building to calculate simple addition, but that is often what it takes to get the ball rolling. Naval says, “Mercenaries work for money. Missionaries build for others. Artists create for themselves.” What is your truth? Truthfully, this wall of coffee tables has started to bog me down lately. It makes sense why this exists. It is a shortcut for how to behave in this world. If you play by the rules, it isn’t risky, you’ll end up fine. Oftentimes, if you step off the beaten path you will actually be punished through small things like not getting into college, then not getting that good job, then not running the big company. To rethink everything that we do on a day to day basis and why we do it is quite paralyzing. It’s so much easier to just go with the flow. So it’s not necessarily correct to go into isolation, and it’s not necessarily right to be one with the herd. What is one to do? I’m starting to think you just need to place yourself in the correct herds. I’m not sure it’s correct to see the world as determinate or indeterminate. The butterfly effect applies very nicely here. We assume that at any snapshot or state in history, reality is captured in time. But the future increases in entropy and indeterminacy. The farther you go out, the more impossible it is to see what it holds. Finance classes in University told me that the core of portfolio theory is to diversify, because the markets hold systemic risk, the markets are efficient! Bullshit. The older I get, the more I trust myself in having convictions of the world. I keep having this underlying question in the back of my head. Sometimes I am wrong, sometimes I am right. If you can be 51% correct consistently as a portfolio manager, you will make a lot of money. Is the future determinate or indeterminate? It depends on how many data points you have to draw a conclusion. Okay, here starts some problems. Right now, everyone is buzzing about AI. That means it may not be an area where you will have an outsized impact, because your efforts will be diluted by competition. Software seems to continue to eat the world. But there is some randomness to this. No one could have predicted the insane growth of the internet in the early 90s. Again, humans have a really hard time thinking exponentially. Who could have predicted to study computer sciences so that you can be ready for the wave. The people who were ready for it were just genuinely interested in it. They were artists, they were the innovators, even before the early adopters on the S-curve. But there is also the question of why bits expanded in the triumph of the internet so much more than the atoms of other areas of innovation. I have my theories. For instance, it’s fucking impossible to start a biotech company in terms of regulation, capital expenditures, and expertise. Software has so much operating leverage that you can fuck up and still ship product. When I was in high school, my favorite quote was Robert Frost’s “Two paths diverged in the wood. I took the path less traveled and that has made all the difference.” I genuinely believe this is the way to go. But there is the question of specialization and broadness. And the question of doing both. And the question of gradually making choices based on intuition. What even are our interests. Sometimes the young people with ideas are just going to be right. They are at the edges with the ideas. I was always interested in biotech, not PE. I’m very happy to have chosen the path that I did. Think the only times that I believe I’ve made the wrong choice are the times I’ve listened to others. Everyone always says that you need to have a passion for it. It shouldn’t be about the money. It should just be about being the change you want to see in the world and working really hard. You can only connect the dots at the end of your career. But what if your truth is being a barista. This has always seemed so inconceivable to me. What is my truth and what is the solid core of it. Why are we interested in anything? What is play? We should continue to play. That is the only way. But it also seems like there’s some merit to continuing to solve harder problems, you can’t bite off more than you can chew. You have to scale your power at a decent pace. But how does one measure this. Hopping onto a rocket ship? Just following your truth? Often, this is the edges of the fractals stain that we call change and innovation. Where are the smartest and hardest working people? I would guess that this is a surprisingly good predictor of what the next century will hold. Often, someone will say something, and I will accept it as fact. Until I think about it again later when I am alone to realize it’s complete horse shit. But we abide by this wall of coffee tables, it hurts our confidence, too. Kyle theory. Indeed, I firmly believe the only way to break down this wall of coffee tables is to spend time alone. It forces you to think for yourself. This is a careful balance, sometimes I let my mind wander and it wanders outside the bounds of reality. We need to check ourselves with people around us sometimes so that we know when we are going off in the wrong direction. I think this is how some people lose their mind and become disconnected from reality. If you spend too much time alone, your concept of how you should act and social norms begins to unravel. Being around others is important because it reminds us how to be human. In the artificial world that is the public education system, things become menacingly mimetic. I remember that in middle school, I got made fun of for the shorts and socks that I wore? But the painful thing about this period is you think that’s what life is. You are in this jail for most of your time and you don’t really know what you’re doing there. You can’t really question it. Your mind is incredibly impressionable. I then thought it was a rule of life that you shouldn’t wear high socks! And you’re also supposed to be learning things? Why? Noone ever told me why. Except one time that I was told to stay in school by a garbage man or I would become like him. That had a surprising impact on me. Thank you, garbage man. But when you’re younger, you play for the sake of play. Then that became soccer, which I became competitive in, but it isn’t clear that I was competing out of mimetic desire. It felt intrinsic. Second semester of high school was the first time I was aware that this was a competition. There was this thing called college and it really mattered which one you went to! I obsessively researched schools like Princeton and what the acceptance criteria was. After I received a C in Honors Geometry first semester and after calculating that this alone almost left me out of the race for a competitive academic program, I was horrified. From that day on, things changed. I was not going to end up as a garbage man. In this case, it was more clear that I was being mimetic. I never questioned the meaning of life. All that I knew was that GPA, extracurriculars, friends, and the like were all that defined my identity. But even in times like these, I would learn because I was interested in the material. While my friends just wanted the good grade, I would focus more on the material, even to the detriment of my grades. I definitely didn’t join the chess club because it was the popular thing to do! And most of my time was spent playing chess rather than studying. I caught some of the worst senioritis out of my entire class. I think that I always knew school was a bit artificial. I even had times where I questioned going to college, which is pretty much heresy in middle class white america. When we are children, The reason capitalism seems to have held up so well is that it provides uncapped opportunity of people to seek their will to power *in this lifetime*, essentially unleashing human drive. It offers the infinite frontier, which I will touch on more later. What is my truth? What is my play? I think my truth and what I’m interested in is always to be the change I want to see in the world. We get to caught up in how big the world is. I think you just need to love the world. And want it to be better for human beings. Love. We really do need to submit to our instincts. Love. Bettering the community. Helping others. What is my problem with this. My problem is that it is a selfish thing to want to create value for others, so by creating value for others, I am really bettering myself–-god the absurdity of reality. Okay, so we are to expand and grow our power. Sure, I can vibe with that. Then the question is what do we choose to be our game. And we are always playing relatively, this creates envy in mimesis. You shouldn’t solve problems too small and you shouldn’t take a bite of an apple too big. Oh and you also shouldn’t even think about this too often. You should submit to your game and only after you level up can you start to think bigger. If you fail, and people do, you just need to be honest with yourself. So I think you can make marginal decisions as you go throughout life. Like annual checks. Assuming information stays relatively constant, you can always look back to your ledger of accord. Once you have made that decision, you submit to that game. It is now your truth. If the information changes you can change. But your truth is simply a reflection of available information. The only problem is when you are half-in, half-out. Okay but the question is you are picking these minibattles in order to strive for something at the end of the tunnel, right? … I almost don’t think you can ever think about the end. Even if you solve aging, then what? If you get rich, then what? It has to be an infinite game. Making a lot of money? I’m actually surprisingly open to this shallow goal. It’s a scoreboard to submit to. But what are the alternatives? Buehler… You need an internal compass. A scoreboard of some sense in which to peg your decision-making to. Values. A corporate mission/vision statement. Thanks for reading Engineering the Future! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work."
"“Of three metamorphoses of the spirit do I tell you: how the spirit becomes a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child. Many heavy things are there for the spirit, the strong reverent spirit that would bear much: for the heavy and the heaviest longs its strength.” - Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Zarathustra Thanks for reading Engineering the Future! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Overcoming The student becomes the teacher. With this quote, Nietzsche illustrates something that we all already understand. It is only until you pass certain levels, that you can move on to the next stage. Life is somewhat of a step function. To get a promotion, you must first master your current role. To matriculate to university, you must first grasp basic mathematics, science and literature. The camel, lion and child represent survival, freedom and creation, respectively. At first, you endure. You, the camel, try every day to pick up a weight that you are not able. Only when you have built the strength to move it freely, can you exert your will upon it. The weight no longer controls you. You, the lion, have mastered it and now control the object. Once you are free to control the movements of the object, you have become the child, and you not only move the object, but you command it creatively in a way that expresses your influence upon the world. In a way, that is all that art and science is. As a scientist, this may mean understanding how the moving parts of a cell interact with each other and how to manipulate it, then mastering the cell (for example, through genetic engineering) and finally altering the cells that you selectively create. As an artist, you become a part of a certain movement, and eventually you branch off in a new distinct way that expresses something that others hadn’t quite captured. I think this symbolic overcoming of self is a relevant symbol that we can view our own lives with, and how we view the obstacles that we would like to overcome. In at least some ways, life is just overcoming obstacles. What is on my mind right now Well, I just got some good sleep at last and a relative breather at work. I can muster the time to focus my thoughts and express what concepts I am struggling with through this essay. What is on my mind often, and what I think is on many peoples’ minds is what the fuck should I be doing right now? Adulthood is leaving the nest of determinacy. You are an independent person. You can do whatever you want within society’s bounds. For most things, you use certain actions to complete certain goals. If you want to make pasta, you execute certain motions in combination with certain ingredients to get a boiling pot of water and noodles. If you want to get an A on a test, you study efficiently to prepare yourself for the questions that test will likely have. School was “easy” because it was at least directed. If you wanted to exceed, you just did what everyone else was doing, but better. The problem arises in life when you realize that there is no test, so what do you do? There is nothing at all. This is what I have noticed in some, not all, of my friends. There is meaning Well, there is at least some meaning. “I think, therefore I am.” I am, therefore, I am one with the universe. I am a part of something, therefore, I have some role and stake in it. While this is all entropy, the human body is enthalpy. We can create our own meaning as Dostoevsky would prescribe. We are animals, and animals have instincts. There is nothing wrong with living life by the rules that were given to us. We can create our own values within the bounds of our existence and innate drive. That can manifest itself through Nietzsche’s will to power, Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, Christianity, Taoism and other value constructs. The truth is, it doesn’t matter, as long as you are practicing what you preach and you preach what you believe. I think at this stage, I am progressively drawing thinner lines in the sand for what I believe. Then I simply act within those bounds. The problem is not having a North Star. People just need direction. What is my meaning I thought it was funny that one day I just decided to find the meaning of life. I thought it was even funnier that I actually made some headway. It’s always been taboo, kind of like how people are okay with the fact that we are all dying every single day. It’s taken years, but at least I’m getting somewhere that is my truth. I think that our meaning is dynamic. I remember in Psychology class, we learned about self-actualization at the top of the pyramid. But what exactly would “self-actualization” entail? Someone please operationally define it for me. I think that it doesn’t exist. I remember thinking that I could end up in a state like the Buddha if I tried hard enough of pure nirvana and transcendence. But then I also think about a younger me. One whose only ambitions were to be better at chess. Equally as ambitious as I am today, at that particular snapshot in time, what I had in life was significantly less than now, in both material possessions and intellect. My understanding of the world was extremely limited, as mine today will likely be in 20 years if I am lucky enough to make it that far. But most notable is the fact that I have probably already exceeded my younger self’s entire lifetime ambitions. It wasn’t even within my grasp that this was possible, and I now realize how relatively little I have achieved universally. Probably, my ambitions extend beyond reality and reason, but I don’t really care. And this is of course just human nature. The constant is our want for more and the delta is what we have. Nerd tangent: I saw a presentation with Ilya Sutskever, where he makes an interesting point that humans’ loss function, essentially optimizing all variables in our lives for a certain outcome, is optimized for survival genetically. I think societal norms probably recalibrate this loss function towards other things like making money in capitalism, but it is still an interesting point. With this fundamental nature, philosophies diverge. One solution is to accept and practice a constant state of acceptance, contentment or submission. Another is to continue to want more and have a sort of pain along the way with some “reward” at the end. Truthfully, the answer here is not clear to me. The first way is somewhat an act of hedonism, you do not sacrifice and you do not see reward, and so you live a content, simple life, but you do not achieve your potential. The second way, you may achieve a relative amount more, but you will live a life of relative suffering. Some propose that you can practice both at certain times. Maybe you can be happy with what you have and also want more, though I do think that is a bit of a paradox. I have approached life in a different, third way, which at the time makes sense to me. Investment horizon I view life like a compounding investment. I always have. Even though I work in and studied finance, I swear I thought this way before and I’m not that cheesy. I view the content life as hedonism–short term benefit for long term sacrifice. I view the aspirational life as dissatisfaction–short term sacrifice for long term achievement. But at the end of your life, you will have to face what you have made of it. The content person will not have much to show for their life, but they will still be content. The aspirational will have done great things, but they will be dissatisfied. Sacrifice is important. The more money you have, the more leverage you have, and the more you can potentially accomplish and the closer you can come to self-actualization. There should be a third way. If you sacrifice early, you can have the benefits of reaping the rewards later. The rate at which you sacrifice can vary by person. And perhaps you can decrease the amount you sacrifice at each stage, so that you can enjoy relatively more of your 30s and relatively more of your 40s and eventually you can ride off into the sunset in your 70s doing what you enjoy while also practicing contentment. This is my strategy for now. I still enjoy life as it comes but I will sacrifice. I probably worked the hardest in my life while I was in high school. The goal is to optimize the net future value of your life. Jeff Bezos lives like this. He gets less attention than Elon, but he obviously worked very hard. Now, he prioritizes sleep, creativity and leading the life that he wants to live. Same thing with Paul Graham. What to actually spend your time doing? After that has been determined, it is a matter of determining what you want to do with your life, an increasingly complicated question for me. This is complicated for me, because, once again, it changes. Few people I know have found their calling. Most of them are delusional about it, but those who have, it is hard to not be envious. I have a friend that told me their meaning was just “to do what they love until they die or it kills them.” And it seems that they are doing just that and doing it well. Perhaps I tend to overbake things, but I always come back to the question of what do I love, and why? What interests me? What is the root of interest? I’ve whittled away at this question for months and have been figuring out several things that make sense to me. Mostly it boils down into that you should do what you are passionate about, that you also are good at, and that you can make a living at, and then the money will come. Your “ ikigai .” Essentially, you are trying to find your life’s work. Like I said before, my younger self would have thought that I had already found it! But no, I’m not there yet. I saw someone say recently that your life’s goal should be something that you are not one of the best at or even the best at in the world. But you are the ONLY one who does it in the world. In other words, you have been the camel (maybe even in different fields), you have been the lion and you are now forging a new creative path as the child. One that no one can keep up with you at. One that also provides value to yourself or others. I do not believe there is anything wrong with being dissatisfied with the present. We should strive. We should aim to find our life’s work as soon as humanly possible and then push the boundaries of our field. The great men we know throughout history did not just carry out convention, they blazed a path with a light so bright you could not avoid noticing even if you tried. They are iconoclasts. I think this creativity is part of what makes us human. What gravitates us to a particular field / space? Once again, a hard question. But I think probably this is a mixture of randomness in what you have been exposed to in your life / what has trained your neural net, your societal backdrop / culture and also that people are interested in things that solve a sort of characterological developmental hurdle in their lives (Jung). These things that interest them help them understand a “truth” of the universe or help them gain something. Like the first carpenter who used a hammer must have loved that tool. For better or worse, capitalism also plays a significant role in how we view our life’s work. The way we have structured society clearly rewards those who carry out work in a way that creates utilitarian value for the masses, or those who capitalize on economic / regulatory inefficiencies. Once again, for better or worse, I am not playing judge here. I think of investment banking as the most capitalist job in the world. In this system, money flows efficiently between parties. The spigot that directs these funds has people who facilitate the transfer of this wealth. Investment bankers have positioned themselves so that they help transfer trillions of dollars. By receiving droplets of that wealth transfer, they earn extremely large sums of money. But truly that they also provide outsized unitary value, they are the gears of the economy and by doing a good job increase economic efficiency. The left and right will take different stances on this but it is a fact of reality. So if you are interested in something that doesn’t make money, should you abandon it? At this point in time, I believe it depends. I am happy with the system. For me, it offers an efficient sandbox to allocate my time and resources in ways in which I can be rewarded. If I were an early human, maybe fire would interest me. If I were in Florence in the 1500s, maybe I would be drawn to astronomy and the arts. If you were interested in something that forced you to be a peasant or women wouldn’t talk to you in the time, it would probably force your hand into a different interest, unless you were such a strong believer in that ideal But the date is April 29, 2023. My reality is that I live in an age of rapid technological progress and an opening frontier of science. The idea of that is interesting to me because of the potential for it to increase my own life. I was really interested in quantum physics for a time in high school. I am not smart enough to make a living in that, so I avoid it. This is a taboo reality of my life, and maybe a reality of many. It took me a lot of introspection to realize it, but I think it is true. And moreover, I don’t think it is a bad thing. This system isn’t perfect, but it is what we have, we can only expect to make incremental change. As a constituent of the system, I will earn what I can, and hopefully I can provide a lot of value to others along the way. The 3 parts of interest I believe that the 3 parts of interest that converge are simply what you believe in, what you are good at, and what is possible. As Richard Hamming put it, philosophy (what should be done), science (what can be done), and engineering (what is possible to be done). And the most visible way, the Japanese term Ikigai , encompassing “what you love,” “what you are good at,” “what you can be paid for” and “what the world needs.” Side note, would you ever find this if you were always content? Or would you always be in a state of ikigai? Like the camel, lion and child, you will go through different stages of development in reaching for this goal of constant self-attainment. Step functions I worked like a dog when trying to start my prior startup, Nephra. Along the way, I made so many mistakes. But I do not regret them at all. I think they were important mistakes that I learned from and helped me course-correct my entire life. For instance, the work ethic that works in school is to just put your head down and grind something out, but I learned you need a functional and aligned team, leadership / skills (I had 0 before), I learned that technical innovation / good engineering is the bottleneck of progress, I learned that you have to pick your head up and that ambition for the sake of ambition is not scalable. I learned that unclear technology first needs to make the innovation clear. When the dust settles, then you execute impossibly hard. I learned that there are holes in the world and that anyone can find them and solve them by focusing incredibly hard on a specific problem. Most importantly, I realized that I really enjoyed doing this, and I would have never figured that out in school or my current job. I defined a better understanding of what my skills / weaknesses are. I could go on forever, but the point is that incredible anguish and sacrifice led me to a stronger understanding and foundation of the world, from which I can continue to work to level up. I’ve said this before in my “YEAR OF STARTUPS” essay. But many things in this life are step functions. Whether you want to call it “fake it til you make it” or whether you want to describe it as forming abstractions of knowledge to form future decision making, it comes with time and perseverance. The value that board members offer to a company is pattern recognition. They have seen all this shit before. They can offer advice that they have learned in their merited careers. You also see that these people value their time differently. I think of time differently now (I will speak to this shortly). A subtle lesson from this is that work starts out as brute force. As you progress into more valuable careers, you progressively do less bitch work. Suddenly, you have something to bring to the table. Your accumulated experience is actually an asset. You are beginning the stage of the lion. Another lesson from this is that in our society, your brain matters more than your brawn. Intellect is scalable. There are people today that can snap their fingers and make a few calls that will earn them more than an entire household will earn in a lifetime. The final thing that I learned from Nephra, and one that I only recently accepted, is that your skillset matters greatly. It is not enough to just want to start a company in an area you subtly believe in. You have to embody that mission. You have to know everything about your area and more, because one day you will compete. This matters more in established fields like law and finance. If you are a leading attorney / managing director, you are the asset. You can create your own company around you. If you are creating something new, it’s fine if you are not an expert, because there is nothing to be an expert in. You are becoming the expert as you go. There is uncertainty here. But those who believe in something with strong conviction and see a future where others see nothing, are the leaders. You need to have a skill. What will it be? This is what you will develop over your life, choose wisely. Your career This is where I am now. How do I want to spend my time to become the person that I want to be? This means a combination of learning, experience, and building a network. It matters what you do in addition to how you do it. Obviously, you should also try to make money in your career. Like before, I view this as maximizing net future value of earnings. This means a tradeoff of at every step along the way. You should focus on learning at the beginning of your career and earning later, ceteris paribus. You are your own brand. Your network has value. Your skills have value. And the money you may or may not have has value. I like biotech innovation. I think it will change the world. I would prefer to be a (generalist over specialist). “Having a vision is what separates the leaders from the followers.”- Hamming, so . You should create the change you want to see in the world. I like new and uncertain areas. I like trying to map out emerging fields that uncertain, making sense of all the clutter and organizing it into a determinate view of the future, then creating something aligned with my convictions. Determinacy comes from understanding, which comes from reading and any skills / knowledge you possess. What I also learned from Nephra is that anyone can have a view of the future. The bottleneck is people who can actually engineer the damn thing. So, personally, I think that is something I would like to develop in my life. But at the same time, is that scalable? I think the best CEOs are technical. It may just be another stage that I will have to go through. Indeterminacy = you should learn Determinacy = you should execute You should think about work for what it is. You are giving your time and human focus in exchange for money. If you are lucky, you can also build skills and networks. If you are luckier yet, you have the opportunity to do exactly your ikigai. If you are yet again luckier, you can have ownership, control and equity in it. What I like, solving problems. Building. Philosophy. Ambition. Thanks for reading Engineering the Future!

"“When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.” Thanks for reading Engineering the Future!

But try saying it to yourself in the mirror, it feels funny to me at least. For most of our young adult lives, we are funneled through family home life, then high school, then college, all of the time being held to others’ standards (grades, house rules, etc). I was interested in STEM, so it wasn’t a big deal, but I hold a lot of sympathy for those who wanted to pursue their dreams in the arts. These people aren’t wrong in any sense, they are just misunderstood, they have different fundamental beliefs, and discussions devolve into arguments because neither party realizes they are speaking different languages. Your interests are actually largely defined by your genetic makeup and upbringing (for instance, you can accurately predict liberalism and conservatism based on ). The usual rebuttal is you aren’t going to make enough money, but for someone who truly has withdrawals when they aren’t working on something they love, that passion should be celebrated, not put down. Remarkably, it usually works out for the people who are truly connected to their work. Once you understand this world is just as much yours as it is anyone else’s, you will interface with it differently. Henry Ford is quoted “Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t – you’re right.” An overused quote for sure, but it is true, the problem is there aren’t enough people taking shots on goal. Why? What are you going to regret when you’re 80 and dying–you are going to regret that you didn’t take the risks, . A university will always accept you and your tuition dollars open-armed later and there will always be a business who needs an employee, the risks are smaller than you think. My approach is being thought through in the succeeding paragraphs. The context to these thoughts I’ve been having is the natural lost feeling that new grads have when they start their jobs. At first it’s amazing, they’re paying for nice dinners, work happy hours, your colleagues are nice, you’re working on interesting things. But then you start to think about why they are treating you so well and what you are giving in return. It’s somewhat unsettling that the constant happy hours buttering you up are a tactic found in 1984’s . They are paying you a market value because that is what they value your time at. In order to numb you and keep you content, they fill up your Maslow’s hierarchy of needs (a theme I continually return to). That is to say they are providing you with the monetary reimbursement for your time to cover rent and food expenses, they are providing you with colleagues to feel like you are a part of a community, they are strapping you to the company’s goals and visions so that you feel like you are a part of something bigger than yourself. All of this is done to make you feel content and turning good work product day-in and day-out. Truth is, I actually really enjoy my job, and that is the scariest part. I could live and float around on others’ equity or I could live life on my own terms and not spend ~50% of my finite time on earth on someone’s payroll, but rather scale my own life. This is fine and good if you genuinely don’t mind, but it leaves a constant bad taste in my mouth. Not only am I spending some of the last formative prefrontal cortex years of my life on someone else’s agenda, but I look to the executives, no different than I, pulling in millions on the back of my labor. They are experts in their field who no doubt earned their place. But then I took a step back and looked at the seismic socioeconomic shift occurring. Banking is an artifact of old Wall Street, a meritocracy where the best rose in an “up and out” world to those who didn’t perform. The world seemed fixed, the opportunity was in these corporations. But then the internet came, the , people started large companies like ViaWeb, Netscape, Google, Facebook and PayPal. I started my essay, , with this quote, “We are living in the best time to be a Founder in history. IBM, founded in 1896, took 45 years to reach a billion 2020 dollars in revenue. Hewlett-Packard, founded in 1939, took 25 years. Microsoft, founded in 1975, took 13 years. Now the norm for fast-growing companies is 7 or 8 years. This trend will only accelerate” - Paul Graham. People are out-earning bankers creating, rather than fighting for scraps in a sharp-elbowed environment. I then looked at these people, and I found that these founders are also no different than I. In fact, they aren’t even just lucky. Look at the image below of the original founding team of PayPal. People like Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, Max Levchin, David Sacks, nearly every single one of them went on to create massive value for themselves and others through various ventures. This isn’t in isolation, people don’t realize how valuable they are if they just put in the time, per my last essay, human focus is Earth’s most valuable commodity [ ]. Y Combinator funds people often with only an idea, and they have created over $1T in market . Not to mention the Thiel Fellowship. The people that succeed are the type of people that succeed. Then it is a matter of execution [ ]. The PayPal mafia simply learned how to create a business in the internet age and then proceeded to repeat the steps for new companies like Tesla, Founders Fund, YouTube, LinkedIn, Palantir, Affirm, do you get the point? The largest labor arbitrage opportunity glaring down the face of America is reopening the frontier and creating a culture where people believe in themselves enough to take risks. I hope to do that at . After starting and , the most amazing byproduct was seeing this realization take hold. Once you start something, you realize you can. You can almost see a progressive reignition of curiosity in your peers' eyes. Finance was the open frontier at one point, then it became saturated to an extent. This cycle is happening on the internet right now. The interesting characteristic that is self-evident of the frontier is that it is inherently infinite. But there are other frontiers opening like web3 and AI, and that is what’s exciting to me. Capturing the Frontier is the way to build wealth quickly. Doing so is a matter of understanding the history of the world, the present, and the future. To which, I argue that <blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">Seeing the future is a function of seeing the present. Seeing the future is no different than seeing the present, with pattern recognition</p>&mdash; Jonathan Politzki (@ITNAmatter) <a href="" 5, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script> This is the beginning of my personal philosophy into how to engineer the future. This isn’t something you can randomly wander into. Startup founders tend to be philosophers. Or at the very minimum have a belief on a certain matter they are interested in. You have to understand a field enough, map it out, and see what the gaps are. Often, that is just creating a product that you yourself would use, and trusting that there are more people on Earth like you. This video of Quentin Tarantino is all you need to know about founder-product-market fit. He’s making his videos for a very specific audience, himself. <blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">Quentin Tarantino says he makes movies with a very specific audience in mind: <a href="" 6, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script> Balaji Srinivasan is also saying, “The only reason you should start a startup is if you need to build something you can’t buy.” Often, you are not alone! Engineering the future is a function of consuming enough information so that you understand the world, connecting the dots, writing in order to flesh out what you truly believe, then executing upon engineering said world that should exist. It takes creativity to create. The reason this is probably daunting to so many is that it is easy to flow through life and not take any stake. To take a stake in life risks failure, and historically death. Deviant thinking is a rare trait because the independence associated with it mostly meant ostracization by your tribe, which historically meant death. It is the equivalent of taking the red pill in some sense. You are also taking a massive bet on yourself. But I empirically believe that I am an intelligent and driven individual. In my youth, I would question it. “Should I try to be a doctor, am I smart enough?” “I am lucky to have made it to Wall Street, I should dig my heels in and just be happy I’m here.” NO NO NO, I’m glad I learned those lessons, but believe in yourself! This is the fucked up mindset I’ve had all my life. The only limiting factor you are born with is your intelligence quotient. I don’t know my IQ, and a low IQ could be a detriment to your ability to succeed, but studies show it isn’t even that critical. Paul Graham, founder of Y Combinator cites, “There are plenty of people as smart as Bill Gates who achieve nothing. In most domains, talent is overrated compared to determination—partly because it makes a better story, partly because it gives onlookers an excuse for being lazy, and partly because after a while determination starts to look like talent.” The studies show that the utility of IQ with respect to creativity fades after approximately . The reason for this, according to Peterson, is that IQ serves the purpose of you “catching up” to your peers. Those with a high IQ are simply faster at getting there, but after you’re there, anyone can connect the dots into a new solution. So you can either take the red pill and responsibility for your life and success, because it is contingent on YOU, or take the blue pill and float through life like a fucking loser in a world of comfort, worthlessness, and contentedness. Of course, that is subjective, if it makes you happy, go for it (*cough cough loser). My theory is you’re already all-in on life. You were born knowing you are going to the grave. Make the most of it. How to get skin in the game Be strong in your convictions! The video that has probably had the most pronounced impact on my life and personal philosophy has been a talk by Vinod Khosla, founder of Sun Microsystem and Khosla Ventures, at . He’s brutal, but he’s right. Here are some mild excerpts: ""I am amazed at how few people have a belief system, what do they actually believe in?"" ""You can [be another cog], or you can discover the edges where things are happening and changing, know that you don't know, and really change the world."" ""My personal philosophy is whatever I believe, I should make happen."" These resonate with me. Mostly because I, too, always floated through life, never asking questions, just trying to get the best grades/best job I could muster. I got those things, now what? I was playing the wrong game, I was deceived into sorting myself into the roles set by others, “but life can be much broader than that” if you remember. In order to change the world, you need to understand it. As aforementioned, philosophy is understanding the world, picking apart its moving pieces in isolation and in conjunction for what they are most fundamentally relative to the laws of nature/the logos. Much of our life is taken for granted, but if you really break it down, its absurdity is revealed, like an existential realizing how odd everything is (e.g. being taken aback from a seat. “Instead of it being the most basic and obvious piece of design, scarcely worth a moment’s notice, the seat promptly strikes him as deeply strange; the word ‘seat’ comes loose from its moorings, the object it refers to shines forth in all its primordial oddity, as if he’s never seen one before.” Taken for what it is, its odd shape, leather-bound and created by skinning an animal and stuffed with artificially created filler, just to be placed on a 4 wheeled machine with a room so more intelligent animals can sit on it and be transported across densely packed concrete structures). Everything is the way it is due to man-made path dependencies. Humans often associate a form of nostalgia looking back on the way they used to view the world in youth, when they would be in awe by the crackle of fireworks. Now numb as an adult as you have adjusted to the phenomena and take it for what it is. This numbness is your body adjusting to its environment, using heuristics to simplify processes, it is an evolutionary adaptation. The best way to fit your neural network to the ideas of philosophy is to expose yourself to them, with a steady fastidiousness of truth. The best way to do that is to read literature that has passed the test of time. Nassim Taleb, in his book Antifragile, says there is a good reason it has lasted, because people still agree with it. Therefore the longest lasting novels have been continually revalidated. The same goes for companies, Apple fills a very true need in people’s lives and they continue to pay and validate the company’s value. After you understand the world, and the world that should exist, it is a matter of creating that world. This comes from an understanding of the tools at your disposal and allocating resources effectively to drive that agenda. The most valuable meta-tool is human focus, because humans move mountains. So you need to get the best people on board, because companies are just collections of people. My favorite examples of this are the blogger who traded in a paper clip for a house in 14 . Or the YouTuber who traveled across the country and survived 30 days with just a penny. People can do amazing things, they just need to be organized to do them. These humans equipped with strong technical skills and motivation will change the world, they just need guidance. In essence, you need philosophy to understand what changes should be actualized, and then you need resources and engineering to back into that worldview. The engineering that I’m most interested in is computer engineering and computer science, because you can effectively code a computer to solve any problem, and then scale it to the masses with strong operating leverage. Why am I interested in these things? I don’t really know, I try to pin it down and can’t. There probably isn’t a word in the English language for it, but at this point, I’m not going to question it anymore. It’s an interest in reaching the truth and the logos. I like the following quote from Naval. <blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">Mercenaries work for money. Missionaries build for others. Artists create for themselves.</p>&mdash; Naval (@naval) <a href="" 24, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script> I think about the starving artists, who create because they have to. They don’t have a choice. I think about the traveling Chess player, who knows they are broke, but they have to pursue the game because it would pain them to not. Chess is actually a really good analog, considering I spent more time playing chess than studying in high school. What I liked about chess was it was seemingly simple, yet infinitely complex. Chess is a determinate game, there is no solution, but the moves you make are certainly important. It’s like life, but you are given perfect information. Furthermore, you sit across from someone and it is the purest form of a battle of the wits. It’s extremely competitive, and I can be very competitive. I made two people cry and few things have brought me such joy. Life is like chess, infinitely complex, but you are given imperfect information. Come to think of it, that’s why philosophy is important, because you are collecting information that could serve to be a competitive advantage. Pure chess is engineering, because you are solving a determinate problem. I’ve simply channeled these interests into philosophy (finding problems), engineering/innovation (solving problems), and business (ambition/competitiveness). These just so happen to be the traits that the most successful people in our society have, and I will use that to my advantage. If I fail (which I won’t), there will always be things to fall back on.

"Work Lately, I’ve been obsessed with the idea of work. Of the most meaningful things we will do in our lives, it is a high possibility that it will come from our work. It is one of the constant variables throughout human history. We are hardwired to work. This is mostly because humans are hardwired (1) to survive and (2) to thrive. We work to get our basic needs in line, then climb Maslow’s hierarchy in search for more. We’re in an age of more, so let’s question what that more should be? Investment is another core trait of an evolved species. When we have abundance, enough to keep our head above water, we allocate our resources towards long-term yield. Early humans invested in irrigation systems, farming, and other technologies to expand the scope and scale of human ability. With easier crop yield, we can build more technologies and armies to increase our safety and quality of life, with the intention of continued expansion. These layers of abstraction are something that I’m curious about. Society at Work Societies that work, work. Those that don’t, don’t. Those societies that have triumphed throughout history have been centers of innovation and investment, which bring long-term wealth and power. Every human is incentivized to work for different reasons. Some want to create art, because it solves something deep within them. Some like community, so they like to interact with others. The capitalist is incentivized to work to create value, and then retain some percentage of it in the transfer of it. I’ve been curious about capitalism lately. Under the flag of capitalism, us humans guided by incentive are pushed to create value. A society of capitalists is more likely to innovate, build wealth and win. Capitalism has Flaws This is a system that works well, but I think about its failures, and whether we could find ways to improve upon it. With capitalism, people often conflate the idea of value with money—it becomes an abstraction. I argue that this causes us to lose sight of what it means to be human and to continue to progress as a society. In this game, the scoreboard is read in an amount of $. But money is not a perfect proxy for value in a society. At least in our current age, I think of cigarettes companies, social media click engineering, and the pornography industries as failures of this system dependent on the decentralized transfer of value preying on the more primitive human cortices to extract value. I asked people close to me what their ideal work-life would be if money wasn’t an issue. You should attempt to ask yourself the same question. I found people do want to work, and they think of it as a way to add value to a community. Interestingly, those that worked in industries like law and finance often separated work and life. They saw work as: work to live rather than live to work. My hypothesis is that this is a result of our system. If money weren’t important, you wouldn’t spend your entire life trying to stack it. You would likely still strive, but it would be something more clearly for the community. Many do find a good combination of adding value, enjoying it and making money. That is ideal. Striving Part of what work offers me is something to strive towards. I’ve always enjoyed working hard towards an exciting goal. I’ve been thinking about what the goal of my life should be. I’ve been thinking more about this recently. Shamelessly, I do want to make a lot of money. It’s something to strive for. When I was younger, perhaps it wouldn’t matter as much how I did it. Now, I feel like I have more integrity in how I think about that. I want to make a lot of money by adding real value to the world. Output, Scaled It is clear that some people add more value than others to the world. And some people build outsized wealth. I think about how to do those things as well. I’ve never believed that success is based on luck. I’ve thought about the success of each member of the PayPal mafia, Michael Milken’s comeback from prison, and other serial entrepreneurs who strike gold time and time again. There are likely extraneous variables here, but I think that these people know something that I don’t. I think this is something that can be learned. If that is the case, I want to learn it. Inputs I used to think that if I worked as hard as I could, that was always the key to success. Looking around now, and I think that I was partially misguided. Paul Graham would also agree that you need to work hard to succeed, but there are plenty of people who work incredibly hard and achieve nothing. It matters what you are doing when you work hard. The hardest working waitress does not have leverage. It seems like humans often underweight our own time and what the cost of an hour of our life should be. If you know that some people’s time is worth 1,000x yours, why not try to add value to match that. Removing ourselves from the abstraction of money, most fundamentally, businesses create value and then capture a portion of it. y=mx+b. y=resulting capital, m=% of value captured, x=value provided, b=initial capital In business, it is also true that some avenues are more difficult to make money. Some have hard-to-reach customers, high initial capital expenditure requirements, limited available quality talent, regulatory pressure, and difficult engineering problems. Over time, you want to grow y exponentially. Peter Thiel makes a couple of interesting counterintuitive arguments. (1) we think of capitalism and competition as synonyms, but they are not and (2) we think that we are living in an age of rapid technological progress, but we are not. (1) The point he is trying to make here is that in a world of perfect competition, the variable m gets whittled away. This is intuitive as an after-thought, but most businesses that are started are repetitions of what has worked prior. Thiel argues that the next Mark Zuckerberg will not start a social media platform and that these waves of innovation are inherently idiosyncratic. I’ve been really interested in this idea of competition, which I will dive deeper in its own section later. The capitalist is the businessman who stacks capital. In capitalism, we are incentivized to pursue projects that make a lot of money. (2) Because we are incentivized to make a lot of money, we often don’t solve the problems that need to be solved. The soundbite he is quoted by is “we wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.” Software has been the boon of wealth over the last score. These 20 years have seen rapid adoption of the internet and digitization of our entire society. The idea that we have advanced computers in our pockets while we ride a dilapidating subway in New York City is indicative that maybe we aren’t progressing on all fronts. Software is an incredible business model due to its operating leverage (fixed costs/total costs), scalability, and network effects. There was also an open frontier with white space for this generation’s tech companies to build on. When I was building Nephra, I was always subtly jealous of any of those around me that were working on software projects, who could release a product in a week, simply talk to customers and iterate, who didn’t need to do years of interactions with the FDA, peel back layers of technical risk, burn $millions/year, draw up a manufacturing schema and pathway to commercialization in addition to the unknown of whether the damn thing would have product-market-payor-provider fit with all the major stakeholders in the industry. While it could have been done, I was not able to do it. If I had actually created any value, it would have been incredibly hard to capture any of it. If I am incentivized at least in part by money, why on earth would I try to build a biotech company? This is why I think he is onto something. Okay, so that’s the answer, right? Build software companies and scale them to the moon! – not quite… Competition Coming to the idea of competition. As an investor at Founders Fund, Thiel expresses some of the patterns he has noticed. These are also something that people make fun of Silicon Valley for often. Founders pitch that they are “building the Uber for dogs” or “disrupting big data using AI.” These words can act as a “tell,” like in poker, that you are bluffing, and you aren’t doing anything new at all. When America was founded, ambitious types moved from all over the world to seek opportunity in a new nation, building the culture that we have today. When gold was found on the west coast, the area was inundated with these personalities. This cycle happens over and over. Then on Wall Street, then in Silicon Valley. But of course, after everyone rushes in, the space becomes incredibly competitive and largely washes away promise of profit. The point that he is trying to make here is the following: because each wave of innovation is so distinct, if you are trying to become the next Mark Zuckerberg by building a social network, you aren’t learning from him at all. You are heading towards competition. This is a principle that he shows with his own life story, and one that I can at least a little relate to. As an incredibly tracked student in high school, his classmates predicted he would get into Stanford, then he got into Stanford. He later matriculated to Stanford Law School, before moving to a big law firm in New York City “where everyone on the outside was trying to get in and everyone on the inside was trying to get out.” When he finally left this competition, he found great success from starting a macro hedge fund, co-founding PayPal and Palantir, and being the first outside investor in Facebook’s Series A. Banking seems the same. It is the tried-and-true way to build wealth, and so the recruitment process is incredibly competitive. While of course, there are an infinite number of ways to build wealth, succeed and solve problems in society, we are herd animals and like to hedge our risk in every possible way. Banks play an important lasting role in society, but the point is that people know that and there isn’t an opportunity arbitrage. So, at what point, we need to ask ourselves, does this competition become zero-sum? That is a question, not a statement. In banking at least, I feel like I’ve learned so much from the path. It sharpens you and teaches you the lessons that have remained core to America’s financial system. But in a world of opportunity, we should ask ourselves if there is an open door just around the corner. Have an Internal Compass I am going to write this section to pick on my value investor friends. It seems to me that the whole idea beneath the Ben Graham, Buffett, Intelligent Investor philosophy is to say, “the future is uncertain, therefore, I am going to systematize my investment process in a way that can capture value mathematically.” By projecting cash flows of a stable company to find mispricing, you can arbitrage that company’s value. Whether or not this is a productive process that adds value to society is another question that I don’t know the answer to. Of course, there is entropy in the future and the butterfly effect, but I do not believe the future is a lottery ticket. There are those that know topics so well that they can reasonably project the future. I do think, however, that this investment mindset is an important tool to have. But once someone understands value mispricing, they should go one step further and develop a conviction in the future that they can extract additional alpha through. Maybe this is what you guys already believe though. First Principles Admittedly, when I think about why I wanted to work in finance, it seems like a sort of risk mitigation technique. Other friends I speak with seem to think similarly. Build a decent enough nest egg, then pursue something when your life is already set. But what if that takes 10-20 years? Why do we not think of the risk of never doing anything meaningful with our lives. “In just 10 years, Napolean went from an unknown artillery officer to the emperor of the largest empire Europe had seen in 1000 years.” If only he knew that he could have played it safe and instead saved and invested his military wage to retire early. Admittedly, I think I could look at the above chart and say, “I’d rather be the investor because they can make all the money without all the risk.” So, one then competes to get one of those spots. And you can work hard to take that path, but something feels transcendentally off to me. What I think it is, is that if I wouldn’t have that job, someone else would. I think there’s something very meaningful about doing something that no one else is doing. It’s like if you have 8 people carrying a table that only needs 2. Are you really offering any value, marginally? Risk/Leverage I have been thinking a lot more about that graph. It seems to me that the further you move to the right, the more you remove yourself from the actual problems on the ground floor of society. As an employee, you are in the weeds. As a founder, you may have found a specific problem that you can reasonably change. Maybe as a venture investor, you take on a sector theme that you believe in the world. By the time you are a Fund of Funds, you are so abstracted and removed from society. You have massive influence, but it’s so damn abstracted and competitive. But I think there may be a cadence to these things. I almost feel like I need to earn each rung. You can’t really start a company if you don’t know how to lead employees or know the granular work you are going to do. The best VCs seem to have experience building a company themselves. Then you are getting into financial engineering, which is arguably a different skillset, but if you had the below in addition, it would make you a far more competitive investor to know the product, industry, business, and finance. As you progress to the right, it’s seemingly harder to get started. It’s easy to be an employee. It’s harder to be a founder but there’s no gatekeeping items, I can just start and see if you find uncharted territory filled with value. It’s not quite that easy to start a private equity firm. So, the doors are somewhat closed. It’s hyper-competitive and it’s up and out. There’s more leverage with the founder. In theory, a founder can bootstrap a billion-dollar company. It comes down to your personal ability. This is max risk, max opportunity. This is also a higher conviction role. You need to fundamentally believe there is value in a place no one else is looking. Solve Problems It's easy to look at these things and see the abstract, after-the-fact version where we try to repeat Warren Buffett’s path to success. As a founder, people may try to be the next Bezos. But if you look at all of these founders, like Thiel says, it’s always its own case and unique. And they are all solving a problem and then capturing a significant amount of it. I think that when you think about work like this as well, it is much more rewarding and in tune with human nature. You are finding real problems and solving them. In a world where money clouds our judgement, I think I’d like to get back to the basics. If people adopted this mindset, maybe we would have much more than 140 characters. Difficult This process will not be for the faint of heart. Entrepreneurship is always filled with risk and hardship, but isn’t that what it’s all about--human striving and creation? We used to go to war, man."
"Society will not be just until the leaders become philosophers, or the philosophers become leaders. ~ Plato Isn’t it funny that we aren’t taught philosophy or how to think in school? Wisdom is a lost art. The Greeks touted the guiding star of The Logos as the underlying truth of the Universe, with many stoics like Marcus Aurelius (not technically stoic, but assumedly so) using this as their North Star for decision making. Years later, engineering, neuroscience, economics, computer science are all based on an underlying understanding of mathematics and academic reproducibility in an ever-continuing expansion of human consciousness. Mathematics is the most pure sense of The Logos, other hard sciences as well. As you start moving into political sciences and other liberal arts, things get more fluffy and intangible. Everything can be broken down into an underlying truth, however, we don’t have the answers for the majority of the Universe’s questions yet. That’s what our purpose is. We don’t talk about The Logos anymore, but I think we should. As a species, it’s significant. Human emotions and history repeat themselves, but science and technology is what grows. No matter what obstacle, hindrance, etc. it should be noted that humanity has *always* moved past it. We have always grown, dispersed freedom, increased economic opportunity, health, all of which are the result of The Logos. Thanks for reading Engineering the Future! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. I haven’t written in a while. When I started this, I told myself I would write on a recurring basis; however, you can’t force it. Essays come after collecting data points of knowledge, which I usually use on my note pad for this, and connecting the dots to draw conclusions. This is my way of making sense out of life and developing a guiding philosophy. Most of which could have been much longer, but I try to keep it somewhat condensed believe it or not. Also note that this is the world in my own eyes, it is going to be different in the eyes of the reader, and I would honestly appreciate any commentary given I spend a lot of time in my own head and would like to hear the opinions of others as a sanity check. For reasons I go into more in this essay, many people never try to understand themselves, or the world around them for that matter. Life is like a stream, and the current can carry you along the entire way. Sometimes, though, it is helpful to remove yourself, sit with nothing but your thoughts, observe the stream for what it is most fundamentally, before course correcting and reentering this game of life. This isn’t going to be a well-organized essay, but it involves the importance of understanding who we are and thinking deeply about how we choose to spend our finite time on earth and maximizing our impact. It then leads into The Network State, a new concept exploring the potential first innovation in political science since the founding of The United States. Then finally, how we can combine these innovations into potential societal structures that seek to maximize human focus, what I argue is our most valuable, yet underutilized resource. Know yourself Psychology was interesting in high school, but this was also an ironic time of life to study it, considering how artificial the American education system is. It is important for young people, and specifically to the point of Paul Graham, that “nerds understand school is not life. School is a strange, artificial thing, half sterile and half feral. It's all-encompassing, like life, but it isn't the real thing. It's only temporary, and if you look, you can see beyond it even while you're still in it.” It wasn’t clear that people were so unique at the time. Sure, people were stratified into different social groups/castes, but everyone was playing the same game in high school [ ]. For me, it was very clear what my objectives were: getting into college, friends, GPA, and my extracurriculars of choice–we were all similarly graded by our class rank. Most teenagers have a similarly simple view of life in these years. In a time where we are developing who we will be for the rest of our lives, there is a prescribed bound set of expectations for the ways in which we should be developing, which is discouraged to be questioned. This has at least one advantage: high school and our curriculum has a common denominator of truth (for the most part) in classes. When the brain is developing, it builds upon the data points that it collects. I like to think about it as an extremely convoluted neural network as taught in upper level computer science classes (see image below of a simplified convolutional neural network representing the number 6). So when there are tidbits of untruths caught in this web, it can corrupt the foundation and may make it more difficult to make sense of incoming stimuli due to false precepts. You are what you think and you think what you’re exposed to. Your body is the hardware, and your neural pathways should be considered nothing more than your software. But I am more against the education system than for it. Like many things that I will touch on later, I believe its artificial structure and incentives squash creativity, individuality, and the context that students need most. The problem with students all playing the same game is that’s not how the world works–that’s zero sum in a world that is rapidly expanding. Humans are infinitely unique, both as a product of development and genetics. Interesting fact: big 5 personality traits can be linked to different neurotransmitter activity ( ). As a result, they are passionate about different areas, learn in different ways, and should be exposed to different opportunities, which is not captured in a one-size-fits-all approach. Globalization brings the onset of infinite specialization and opportunity, all of which you can learn online, but we train hard in high school (which isn’t even that reflective of college) to train hard in a university (which isn’t even that reflective of the job you will do after) to work hard in that job (which is yet another step removed from your interests/purpose/self actualization). Were you destined to be an accountant at Deloitte? Maybe, but once you understand that the world holds infinite possibilities and that it is within your reach to succeed, would you still choose that as your life’s work? Even in high school, I inferred this, but going to University was an insurance policy against failure. You don’t understand how the world works in high school, so it makes sense to hedge against being a failure. After all, that’s what everyone else is doing, even if it means naively spending inordinate amounts on tuition. I write and work now because I want to. I wrote and worked then because I had to. Notice I would be writing and working either way, why does it need to be in a prescribed manner? I texted 30 friends 2 questions. First, “what do you think about when you’re alone.” As I discussed in a previous essay, we revert to our natural selves when we are alone. Second, I asked what they did for work, to which I received a wide range of really interesting replies, many of which could be made into an actionable career, but were completely diverged from their occupation. Why is there a lack of alignment on what we are interested in and how we spend our finite time on Earth? Maybe playing the same game doesn’t leave time for creativity and individualism? Maybe people just don’t know what is possible, or overestimate the risks? What is more risky, trying a different line of work for a year, or waking up at 80 and having never tried? See the below lyrics for a song that touches upon this. We should always be reminded that we are only one step removed from primates on the evolutionary chain. Us working a 9-5 is no different than of two monkeys doing a task for a food reward. I'm thinking about horses Magnificent beasts But why the fuck do they listen to us? They're so much stronger than they know But they trade their freedom for a dependable meal They let people get on top of them and tell them where to go But how can I judge? Is that not exactly what I do? Is that not exactly what we all do? I'm thinking about horses ( ) I work in biotech investment banking right now, and it’s hard for me to believe how misaligned it is with my personality. But I couldn’t have known this in college, because I was playing a different game, just competing to win against others in my class. I have the gift of working hard as a natural tendency, so why would I spend that building equity for someone else? I have the natural gift of interest in engineering, innovation, solving problems, and starting companies, so why would I spend my finite time on earth in Microsoft Excel? That’s not to say it doesn’t make sense to work, it often does, it should just be a place where you can grow, learn, build equity, forge relationships, or where the time you spend is aligned with your guiding philosophy/interests. If I was only in it to stack paper, this would be the right path and for many it is. This is just me, as this entire essay is fit to. I am an independent person, averse to authority, and annoyed by bureaucracy. But this once again leads into a point I will be making later on the differences in humanity and how society can be tailored around this key fact. After actually working in startups, it is my belief that anyone can succeed in entrepreneurship, it is just a matter of focus and sacrifice. But if you’re playing your own game, it won’t feel like a sacrifice. If you do what you love, you’ll be great at it. If you’re great at what you do, you’ll get paid for it. There is an imbalance in that this benefits certain occupations in STEM that often provide more value to society than others, but I still think it can be applied broadly. “ The world is set up in a way in which you can have any one thing you want, but it has to be one thing. ” - Naval Ravikant Your work In my other essay on startups, I spoke about the concept of getting good people on the bus and then motivating them. “Managing can be transactional. You need something done, someone else needs money, so you pay them to do it. In this sense, you ensure that said thing will be completed, but it may not be done well. Managing can be through inspiration, where you guide someone to complete something that they are intrinsically motivated to accomplish. In this sense, you can’t ensure that said thing will be completed, but it will be done to the best of the person’s ability. A salary essentially purchases employees’ time and focus, but it is up to hiring and inspiration to ensure that person is intrinsically motivated to put their best work forward.” We forget how primitive society was in the recent past. In fact, it still is primitive. I’m just trying to project trends into the future, trends which I am extremely optimistic for. Just a reminder that we lived in feudalism in the 9th - 15th century, the industrial revolution started in the latter half of the 18th century, and the internet was only created in 1983 and popularized in 1999. Society is accelerating faster and faster by the day, and we are still adjusting to the internet, let alone the innovations to come. Anyways, humans originally struggled to survive right? Then, they realized that if we came together, decided not to kill each other, and trade instead, it would be mutually beneficial (although it seems we’re still figuring this one out ha). Afterwards, Adam Smith defined the division of labor in 1776. A business owner will relieve your stresses of life by providing you with a wage to pay for food, survive, and barely provide for your family in exchange for your time. This stayed the same for a long time, and eventually the cornfields became cubicles, and society further developed. The wages not only covered people’s food, but the continued specialization of labor led to efficient capital allocation that drove down the cost of food and products for all while also giving a greater wage to the employees, so they could now afford more to provide for their families. The continued advancement of society and abundance has led to employees taking on more creative roles (invention and engineering/solving problems are creative, although often not thought of as such), with machines taking the place of humans. Contrary to some peoples’ belief, no, AI will not take your job. Continued development will mean cheaper resources and more demand for creative labor. Freeing up humans’ time allowed them to create more efficiencies, leading to even more profit at scale. The robber barons and captains of industry are the Zuckerbergs and Bezos of today. Labor has become more expensive to these captains of industry, but it has actually dropped on a per capita basis. I don’t know enough about the topic to say this graph represents causation, but it is certainly a noteworthy coincidence that 1971 was also the year the US abandoned the gold standard, opening the floodgates to printing money, which should be considered for what it is, a backdoor tax. A tax that BTC does not have as large of a problem with. To buy the time of smart humans is expensive, but not relative to the billions in profit they pull in annually. Google and big tech now offer not only competitive salaries, but incredible perks. Instead of just attracting you with pay, they attempt to align your purpose/self-actualization with your work to make sure you are not only present, but motivated to solve some of Earth’s most pressing problems, like search engine optimization and click-rate engineering! How much cash, society’s median of exchange, do you really need? At what point do the employees realize THEY are Earth’s greatest commodities and they can venture out on their own. Why are they paying you so much? Because they value your time at that price, what do YOU value your time at? After you have shelter and food, Maslow’s hierarchy starts to move into areas that can’t be bought with money? Belonging? Esteem? Pretty soon, big tech may run out of firepower to rope you in. The reason I am confident human capital is Earth’s greatest commodity, by the way, is to look at the likes of Elon Musk or any of your inspirations? Not even these people reached their potential, no one does. But imagine if the world was filled with Elon Musks? Hopefully by reading this, I am bending your mind a bit to understand the adjacent possible. The reason that people succeed is no coincidence. The people that succeed do so because they are the kind of person that succeeds. If you drop Warren Buffet in the desert somewhere with nothing, he will be successful again. And this is one of the major realizations of life. The PayPal Mafia went on to build incredible companies after, because they had learned how to succeed and now it was just a matter of repeating the steps. Not only have we not unlocked the first-world, highly educated employees’ time, talent, and focus to work on problems for themselves, but they are the extreme minority. We forget that the average global citizen makes $3,000 a year. There is nothing different about the hardware of these people. They have just been in communities where their potential is not realized for socioeconomic reasons. With the internet, we can build scalable education systems to teach the world computer science and robotics, training the citizens of these nations in skill sets that are useful. China’s focus on manufacturing and India’s focus on developing technical talent has led to unprecedented periods of growth, that if applied to the globe (80% of which is not in the US or China) would unlock massive global talent, to pull us up by our bootstraps and create a more sustainable world. Faction “Mercenaries work for money. Missionaries build for others. Artists create for themselves.” - [ ]. I believe in a creator economy. I’m not the only one, it’s a huge buzzword, for better or worse. Why do I believe in this? Because it’s what I want. The best investments are the companies that we believe in. The best products have always been known to be created by people who would use them themselves. And I have seen first-hand what one person can do with focus, determination, and passion. This does not mean that each project has to have one person working on it, it just means people venturing out and taking more risks and equity in startups. I am a bit odd in the sense that all I need is a place to sleep, food, a computer, and (maybe) a gym. But am I really that odd compared to others? I do not believe that I am the only one. Isn’t that what we all want? When I asked 30 friends what they think about when they’re alone, would they sacrifice some abundance in order to work on their passion? I would be willing to bet my life there are a great number of people like that out there. Maybe the first group/first personality archetype of people that would be interested in this life are the independent/nerdy type, or the type that would rather work 24 hours a day for themselves than 8 hours a day for someone else. These are the people that will succeed regardless if it's for themselves or for someone else. What if communities like this were possible? I believe they are. There are young people out there whose market value is easily $400k. Their time is valuable and they may get sent to a corporation. I have a dream for a community for these people. What Silicon Valley had but lost. How hard would this be, what would these communities look like? Well, they would be created around the founders. Set up in a way to optimize productivity and decrease overhead like rent payments, food, etc. Ideally a community that subsidizes shelter and food so that these people can spend 100% of their time doing what they enjoy most, creating and innovating. The underlying hypothesis being that the people who end up succeeding did because they are the kind of person that succeeds. How much would this cost? One of the craziest realizations of my life was how cheap life is. After making $15,000 in my summer internship, I had a difficult time spending it. It was enough to live off of for some time. I live in New York City right now, where expenses are absurd. Let’s assume that’s not the case. My sophomore year of college, I paid $350 rent in a 4 BR apartment in Champaign, IL. $350 * 12 months = $4,200. What did I spend on food? $35 * 52 = $1,820. Let’s just assume these prices doubled and for the sake of those who will say that’s not enough. The sum of these products was $6,020 * 2 = $12,040. Internet and electricity ~$1,500. $13,540 to buy one year of your own time. Now, what if there was a community that optimized cost of living further, maybe like a dorm but at hostel prices. With cheap food and near a community center like the YMCA. This comes at a time where there are startups developing 3-D printed houses. There is the prospect of $15,000 Tesla Mini Houses on the horizon, Satellite internet is opening up housing to the hinterlands ( ), and there are companies scaling commercialized plant-based meat. We are already living in the future if you pay attention. In a world where you have Y Combinator, Google Ventures, WeWork, Kanye’s Calabasas, Flagship Pioneering, trend toward earlier stage investing/VC, search funds, the creator economy is in movement. Not only do I propose a community like this, but I propose a radical network sovereignty, one inspired from Balaji Srinivasan’s The Network State and Ammous’s The Bitcoin Standard, both of which build upon The Sovereign Individual. The Network State The world today faces a set of challenges that aren’t that new. It is a repackaged face-off between democracy and authoritarianism. A heuristic to think about this is decentralization vs centralization. China has expanded rapidly and is expected to overtake the United States as a new global superpower. The west has been in decline over the last half-century. The USD may lose its footing as a global reserve currency as the US Central Banks inflate away its worth, with countries potentially fleeing to cryptocurrency as the native currency of the internet. There are two potential futures I see. One is a world of centralization using artificial intelligence, and the other is a form of decentralized sovereignty with power, wealth, and creations dispersed amongst the individuals of society. Humans have a tough time seeing beyond linear and into exponential futures. Take a second to imagine artificial general intelligence or the singularity, algorithmic omnipotence. This is a neural network that not only understands all, but scales and learns exponentially. You have a computer that is infinitely smarter than mankind. This, if harnessed, can be used to create good or bad. Good is infinite efficiency for humanity and a life of creativity where human focus is unleashed. Bad is a centralized government that has access to a real-time data stream of all its citizens at all points in time. This is 1984. This is what China is developing right now. Communism has never worked due to the capital allocation problem. That is, the corruption and inefficiencies of centralized powers fail to the invisible hand of capitalism and the west. However, if you have a data stream, can a solution be engineered to this problem while also avoiding the problems that lack of agreement/progress, demagoguery, and decision speed that democracy holds, as predicted by ? I don’t know the answer to this question, but I’m leaning more towards this isn’t the right time for China with the more centralization as of late. I will take a response to my tweet from Rich Excell, a professor, ex-PM, and great follow on or for anyone who would like a better run through of macroeconomic conditions than any news source, who said the following: [ ] “Is the CCP model really working well for them? Or did they benefit from labor arbitrage as Latam did in the 70s and The Asian Tigers did in the 90s before a financial crisis ended each miracle? Chinese demographics are worse than feared. The population will at least halve in the next 70 years. Now we have strongman rule which has historically squelched innovation due to disincentives. Looks like a tough road ahead.” This answer while credited, I’m not sure if it is THE answer, the macro trend towards a Chinese superpower is quite compelling from via Ray Dalio’s chart below ( ). Balaji also noted “By the summer of 1918 the Allies had control of the skies. British, French and American aircraft at times outnumbered their German counterparts five to one.” Today, China and its 1.4 billion citizens are ramping up militarily and forming alliances with energy superpowers like Russia. The US population is 330 million and a population of 530 million includes Western Europe. That means we are now the ones outnumbered, and outnumbered 3:1 (population density graph below). I don’t know what will happen, but historically every major change in world order is followed by a hot war/conflict. If you are on a sinking ship, do you stay on or do you find a lifeboat? This may take longer than you would think, and happen sooner than you expected, so preparing is never a bad idea. Balaji then proposes a new form of government: “A network state is a social network with a moral innovation, a sense of national consciousness, a recognized founder, a capacity for collective action, an in-person level of civility, an integrated cryptocurrency, a consensual government limited by a social smart contract, an archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories, a virtual capital, and an on-chain census that proves a large enough population, income, and real-estate footprint to attain a measure of diplomatic recognition.” This is an odd concept to grasp. Think of a world in which we all work on the web. The economy would be on the web. Peer-to-peer transactions for work. It removes the intermediary of the US dollar and banking system. It removes Uncle Sam’s taxation as an intermediary, the proceeds of which are used to maintain the government’s monopoly on violence. You receive cryptocurrency as a form of payment, an online native currency that could also be used for personal expenditures. The next comments are always the same: “oh well the government is just going to tax it and limit it.” The government may have already opened Pandora's box allowing all of this. China, for their own sake, has stopped it before it could have reached this stage–the argument furthers that democracy will be porous enough for web3 to propagate, but China will be able to limit its adoption. Cryptocurrency can be earned in a way in which its collection circumvents the government, that’s its entire purpose. What happened when the government banned alcohol? I’m sipping wine while typing this. I’m unsure if you could stop a force this large and strong, who knows. Eventually, the central banks will topple as Cryptocurrency offers a more viable solution, then governments will not be able to keep up as The Network State offers more viable decentralized sovereignty, an open-sourced one in which the constituents actually have a say. This will take some time to be fleshed out, and I have a lot of research to do in this space, but Vitalik Buterin advocates quadratic funding whatever that means. Moreover, as a human being you should assume that we will solve the problem of offering a more effective form of democracy. One that arrives at truth, cutting through bureaucracy like a hot butter knife. Because it's possible. My grandparents came to America from Germany and Cuba. In my youth, I was proud of America’s freedom, and I still am proud. However, that doesn’t mean our system is perfect. The Network State to America today is to us as The United States once was to England. The US, as any government, has gotten larger and less efficient over time. The constitution has held up relatively well over the centuries, but it’s obviously imperfectly fit to contemporary society. Like a ratchet, governments get larger and then those agencies incentives are to stay large or get larger. Like a malignant tumor, they expand indefinitely, until the host dies. That is what’s destined for our nation. As Balaji cites, the FDA kills thousands annually just to drug lag alone. This agency that sets global standards is an absolute nightmare to work with. As someone who works in biotech and has attempted to start a healthcare company, it is ridiculous that in order to start a company, you need $10mm+ just to go through clinical trials. How could any normal person start a biotech company? Their heart is in the right place, however, the pace of biotech innovation has been a fraction as a result and has resulted in the ultimate death of thousands of lives every year at the minimum. Ever seen Dallas Buyers Club ? That’s the real world. With government agencies this large and inefficient, there are sadly no solutions. We are not going to have anyone coming into power and making radical changes anytime soon. Those who want to change the world do it through business. As a result, we shouldn’t cling to a dying system. No radical changes are coming to our system? We could be left with no choice but to exit to a new world order. The alternative is we stay with the current world order, which is in stasis at its very best and gets conquered by the East at its worst. This is why I see this as one of, if not the, most important problems of my generation. I say this not as a democrat, not as a conservative, not even as a libertarian, just a global citizen who believes in perpetual pursuit of The Logos for political science, someone who believes decentralized sovereignty will play a huge role in our future. The globe benefited greatly from capitalism’s introduction of efficient allocation of capital through the invisible hand. As discussed, I believe we have yet to nail down an efficient form of governance. This combined with free trade could introduce efficient allocation of capital with efficient regulation (what you can and cannot do), which is an odd and revolutionary concept to even imagine in the world we live in today. Because government is inherently a restrictive force and democracy was set up in a way to balance powers/reject change to maintain the Constitution’s ideals, there is no innovation in government. We will always have the same one. The only two major forms of government duking it out in a competitive market are democracy and totalitarianism. The USA, our champion for democracy, no longer lives up to its ideal and The Network State offers a more democratic solution. Furthermore, the democratic nations of the world based their own doctrine on ours. So just as a result of random path dependence (see image below), the global powers operate the same way, with no way for the world to reconsider. If we assume that the Constitution was imperfect in any way, that has embedded itself into and corrupted the foundation of all democracies. Network States can be joined and exited at will, thus offering a form of rejection for poorly run governments. Which will allow for the convergence of society towards an efficient structure, like capitalism promises, and one that would represent the first major innovation in political science since The Founding Fathers. One thing that should be addressed is that Balaji cites that there will be a decentralization and an eventual recentralization. We don’t think about this much, but there are currently a plethora of micronations, many of which have populations sub-one-million. As aforementioned, there are also a large quantity of 3rd world countries being opened up to new opportunities with the introduction of the internet. If there were to be a new country, with a new economy, this could be an economic lifeboat to grab onto. America was heterogeneous upon arrival at Ellis Island, split by home country, this turned into homogeneity with Americans uniting during the war, which then splintered again with political differences and the increasing disagreement with liberals and conservatives. Remember the paragraph on humans being shoved into a one-size-fits-all state education? That also applies to politics. We have a widely dispersed group of people holding different views on different topics. Often, we actually agree with each other, but we disagree only on party lines. We pick parties, but seldom is someone fully aligned with every one of those parties ideals. This two party system has also led to gridlock and lack of progress, which is at least beneficial as it limits the government from making too many decisions, as those decisions would often turn out miscalculated. A potential outcome is a stratification of society like below into various cultural groups before uniting under a common umbrella law. There could be Irish societies, societies of teachers, societies of artists. You get the point, I can’t predict the future here, but it is an interesting idea. People used to all be the same. Every family in America would tune into the television to watch the same show. The information age opened up a world of diversity that anyone could access. New ways of thought. People began segmenting into various groups and spending time in echo chambers. Healthy discussion and diversity are both highly valued of course. Even in New York, “the melting pot,” while people learn from each other, they still end up sorting into friend groups of similar people. Some potential initial Network States The infinite frontier Men are hungry for responsibility [ ]. Women, too, but more so men. They want more for themselves, but they don’t know how to achieve it. It’s what you think of when you imagine the bright-eyed young apprentice, eager for more responsibility to grow, improve, lead, and create value. I mean, just look at some of these thumbnails. After watching the above video. These titles are tailored to the viewer. “They will respect you!” “Thick skin.” “How to be aggressive.” Weak men trying to become stronger, because that is what men evolved to do in order to survive and reproduce. Those who don’t fill this void through careers or other forms of purpose become lost and that is why we have a generation of men in admiration of figures like Jordan Peterson, Financial Gurus, Joe Rogan, and Andrew Tate. What else do they have to cling on to other than the promise of guidance on escaping the mechanical oppression that is society. Often, school just lacks context. You can imagine a scenario where at the end of your life, you see what you could have been if you had made the right decisions and lived to your fullest potential. If you ended up far from that, it would be extremely depressing. Given this knowledge, most would not make the decisions that they do. If only students knew *why* they should study. If they knew what their potential was, if they understood their personality, knew their gifts/skills, and had an understanding of/conviction for the world around them, of course they would pursue building it for the better. School just isn’t set up that way, you are in a one-size-fits-all curriculum that doesn’t reflect the real world and if it doesn’t fit you, you will assume you don’t belong, unaware that there could be opportunities in the real world you could excel at. Because everyone can succeed if they choose to. Given the chance, many would drop everything in their life for the opportunity to work for great causes and towards new opportunities. Men used to go to war, but that ideal has largely carried into the private sector. Many men didn’t like school, and were rejected by society as a result, winding up in dead-end jobs that are realistically below them. This once again assumes the hypothesis that all can succeed, if they just know how. Communities for these men could be formed, that teaches them the skills of entrepreneurship and innovation, and importantly give them the context needed for what their potential is, help them understand themselves, and teach themselves what they need to know to be value-additive in the real world. Colleges are a step removed from this, companies expect you to already be in this position, and the army isn’t a good enough replacement. This could replace the three above for many that are more fit for this type of environment. The most important point is that the white space this would offer means more opportunity. When there is a lack of opportunity, the world becomes zero-sum. In a lot of investment banks, people are fighting over the same rewards, so people get sharp-elbows. But when the opportunity is outward, there is enough for everyone, and there is a certain power to that message. This is the same power that fueled Manifest Destiny, The American Dream, the internet mania, and the gold rush. It attracts men seeking opportunity like nothing else. Hong Kong and other Suppressed Nations China is the Leviathan strangling freedom out of Hong Kong. Protests have been futile. Russia invaded Ukraine. This is a trend that is going to happen to many countries in the years to come. If an invader overtakes the country’s political system, they can control the country’s economy. If they can control the economy, they control the populace. If the governance is on The Network, it is decentralized and cannot be commandeered. The invaders may still be able to take down an economy and government like this by forcing people to adopt its own, but it is harder to do when everyone has access to a computer and internet. Hong Kong does have limitations in its internet, people cannot access certain websites like Google, so this is another limitation, one that Starlink could potentially solve. With a decentralized cryptocurrency, this becomes harder. Each of these creates an environment where the difficulty threshold for takeover is simply higher. The only way to prevent a point of failure is through distributed nodes, where one corrupted node does not compromise the network. This is the power of decentralization, the internet computer, and The Network State. Creator Campus This idea is just what I had talked about previously. If you assume that great people create value, then you should treat them as the commodity. This means labor arbitrage of people getting paid less than they’re worth. It means setting up a free community to work on whatever they want. Sound infeasible? Let me tell you about . Y Combinator is a startup accelerator that takes promising founders, often strapped with nothing but an idea, and gives them $500,000 to work on anything they’re interested in for 3 months. At the end of the 3-months, they often raise money from VCs. This program has created companies with a combined market value exceeding $1 trillion. That’s not a typo. See below for just some of the companies that have come out of this program. Another experiment started in 2011 is Peter Thiel’s Thiel Fellowship, where 20 - 25 students receive $100,000 if they drop out of school to pursue entrepreneurship and get them out of the classroom. This costs the foundation $2.5 million per class inducted. For a total of $27.5 million. Now, let’s look at the product. “To date, companies created by Thiel Fellows are together valued at more than $46.8 billion, excluding Ethereum which is valued at $450 billion.” ( ) Recently, Figma was sold to Adobe for $20 billion, that was another Thiel Fellow who dropped out of Brown. Nothing to see here, just a 1,702x return on investment. Invest in young, capable founders. Create an environment for them to succeed. Create a strong culture. When new founders come, they adopt it and it persists, then it can be expanded, eventually forming an economy and province/town of its own. Y Combinator takes 7% equity for a sustainable business model, the Thiel Fellowship does not. These successes are not guaranteed of course, but right now young people are taking zero shots on goal, and startups are less risky than they perceive. This doesn’t just have to be the extremely selectively picked students as well. Once this culture is strong enough, people can continue to join and adapt to it. This is the result of only 25 students a year. These are the highly educated. The hypothesis shines through again: the people that end up successful succeed because they are the kind of person that succeeds. That kind of person can be trained, but our education system trains worker bees. We are more powerful than we know, but we trade our freedom for a dependable meal.

"Introduction Overview Thanks for reading Engineering the Future! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. You will die with regret. The reason is you will not ask the right questions. What is the meaning of this all? Why do we do anything? Why do we work in the jobs we do? What defines us as humans? What path should we take in life? Is the world a constant state of what it should be, or are we far from the truth? We have many questions and no answers. Humans have long, yet short lives and few ever question what the purpose of it is. We can not live correctly if we don’t know why we are here. This is important not only so that we move in the right direction and interact with the world in the right way daily, but also because our experiences and actions define our end. People don’t care about the little things, we just want it to have meaning. But we don’t define meaning until it's too late. What would be the result if you played a board game without an understanding of the rules and how to win? Not only would it be an empty experience, but you would wander aimlessly throughout. Humans should not live their lives this way. People should take more time to explore what their values and end goals are. In the following essays, I will attempt to do so on a fundamental level. This is an inherently personal thing, but maybe my experiences will be a proxy of others’. The following essays (this being the first) will look at life in first principles. They will attempt to answer what life is, which direction we should live it, how we find that direction, and what that means for me. This Essay Started from the bottom, now we’re here. Our lives, but temporary cosmic phenomena, have no rhyme or reason. But they aren’t completely random. We think, therefore we are. At birth, our kind is prescribed with a toolkit (our bodies) and instructions (our genetic code) towards directional fulfillment, which is to improve. If we look inward, we can sense what we should make of our lives. We should follow it. This is an easy enough prescription. But what happens when, in our age of rapid technological advancement, the only way to become fulfilled is to go against the grain of the instructions we were prescribed? I’m afraid I will end this essay with more questions, which the next will answer. What is life? 1. First Principles To us, life is a feeling, just a constant sense that you are. To animals, it is instinct, life, and death. To a biologist, it’s evolution. To the universe, life is temporary carbon enthalpy. The word (symbol) we choose to view life as is important, because it determines how we interact with it, humans think in symbols. If you view a cement brick as a geometrically shaped rock, you will fail to recognize its importance in building. The symbols we use are important, because they are a layer of abstraction that covers an underlying truth (the logos ). These symbols are tools used in our understanding of the world around us. First principles. Throughout this essay, I will try to write with first principles. Sometimes it feels like I’m stating the obvious, but it isn’t obvious to me after deeper examination into what we claim to understand naturally. We take for granted many symbols day to day. We should always question our fundamental truths, which is difficult but necessary if we aspire to eject rotten frameworks blurring reality. A physicist is taught to think in first principles. The scientist practices fastidiousness of truth, assuming there is no relationship until the null hypothesis is rejected. Without this, the corrupted abstractions that I mentioned in the prior paragraph stack up and blur understanding until you are stumbling through life. All stumble because we are only human, but those less learned are more blind than others. One only needs reference to Plato's allegory of the cave to see this is where idiots, lunatics, and the honest misguided go astray. Engineers think in first principles. When people talk about their engineering education, a commonly cited benefit, often more than the vocational training itself, is being able to “think like an engineer.” John Quarton, who ran the business/engineering program that I took part in at the University of Illinois, spoke about this in the sense that engineers “break a problem down into 1,000 pieces, solve each piece, then put it back together.” First principles. Meaning through science Life doesn’t have meaning. At least not to molecules, atoms, or planetary physics–but our lives aren’t quite random and meaningless either. Descartes says we think, therefore we are. Is our reality the same reality of the universe? How did life start and how did we get here? At one point in early history, Earth’s atmosphere, containing ammonia, methane, water vapor, and carbon dioxide eventually created organic molecules and eventually self-replicating RNA and the inception of the first microbe around 3.7 billion years ago. After billions of years of evolution, animals became primates which developed sophistication. Brain stems branched out into cortices offering the competitive advantage of reason & creativity. Starting from this major focal point of randomness overcoming entropy, the force of life grew. Evolution is a slow steward of enthalpy, organization, and expansion–nature overcoming itself. We are related quite closely to these primates. Our genomes have 99% overlap, so we aren’t even that relatively advanced. In understanding human nature, it helps to understand apes. What underlying instincts did they pass on to us? We know that before apes there were constants. Animals exist for the purpose of reproduction and ensuring the strength of the next generation. Weak species die. Death and rebirth is a historical constant, so we assume that it will play a major underlying role in the instincts that drive man’s behaviors. We have maintained some constant instincts, since we are cut from the same cloth. These instincts will give us a clue into how we were programmed to behave. They will tell us what “with the grain” is. I will also explore the idea that technology makes man more competitive and has taken over our system of evolution. While the human mind is plastic, we have not been able to adapt to this change completely. Man Initial assumptions on the meaning of life We can run away from these instincts, but we won’t get very far, we’re wearing genes. Should we submit to our instincts or should we conquer them? On average, man’s instincts guide him towards strength and passing on genetics. It is likely true that other social behaviors such as the proclivity towards relationships with others likely played a role in ensuring group survival and synergies between homo sapiens. In man’s newfound free time to think, he has looked around himself to find nothing. We have beaten the game of life and now ask what is its meaning and why we were playing, hearing no answers. Philosophers across time have proposed solutions to the question on the meaning of life. The most converged upon response is that man strives to improve, advance, and grow. Nietzche’s “will to power” captures it well (Nietzche has a stigma, but he doesn’t mean power in the oppressive sense, he rather means impact and influence). But what happens when the actions man must take to become fulfilled are counter to his wiring? Let’s quickly zoom out and view the world as it is today, a stark contrast to recent history. 2. The world is now a machine [ZOOM OUT] Arguably the most important innovation to date is a social contract. Someone said “we would both benefit if I promise to not kill you and you promise to not kill me.” A NEW RELIGION. The glue holding together every nut and bolt of society is based on social contracts of the legal, cultural, and now the if/then repository kind. The more efficient and transparent the social contracts, the more efficient and transparent the society. Social constructs are used to create laws and mechanize society into a well-oiled machine. Everything, including a nation, company, or human starts out as entropy. It’s ideal to stay lean and nimble forever, but growth is cancerous. In order to expand while maintaining continuity, structures create guardrails. These guardrails inhibit flexibility and speed. Humans are born with a blank slate. By 70, we’re stuck in our ways. Old dogs with brains full of old tricks. The world is becoming a computer (an extension of machination) Everything around us is going from analog to digital. Computers have allowed societies to expand their scale, scope, and reach while increasing centralization. The machine becomes more efficient until one day it will be inevitably run entirely by computers. This is not science fiction, it is in the near future. It's all becoming digital at the rate of Moore’s law. In a world like this, those who will thrive are those who operate the most logical–like computers. That’s why for the first time in history, it may actually be a competitive advantage to have a minor form of asperger’s. Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, some of the youngest billionaires in history are pictured below. Not quite the archetype that would have conquered cities in times past. Neither are right or wrong, just change. I’m probably more of a dork than not. 3. A Problem: We Weren’t Built for This We have a problem. I will give an optimistic solution at the end, but I will first be a cynic. Cultural and technological evolution outpace human evolution. We aren’t computers, we aren’t fully reasoning beings, but logic is the greatest competitive advantage in our age. As a result, humans reject the primitive nature of our low-level brain. “Sins” have been viewed upon with shame throughout history. Surely, this pompous sophistication has not been around forever, but learned. During some period of time, we transformed from a primitive state of mind to one of morals. When did it start and at what point in history can we pin it down? This is when instinct was overcome by human intelligence, reason, communication, and problem solving. Playing chess based on intuition is not a competitive strategy, calculation wins. We like to think we are complex creatures, but AI researchers’ quest to understand how we can make computers think like humans has only revealed how simple humans are and that computation and iteration will soon reign supreme. Humans now use computation and iteration as a crutch to advance themselves. This is against the grain of the human condition Our genetic code doesn’t get updated at the pace of our own influence on the world. We were left with the same instincts that were competitive millions of years ago. We are Neanderthals that stumbled upon a book on quantum physics and we inherited more complexity than we were hardwired to manage. Societies were created to structure behaviors in a way that benefits technological advancement and order. We no longer have control over runaway innovation. Who is in charge of all this science!?!?! It may not be the case that this was purposeful, it was just steps of social evolution. The system that harnessed entropy the best survived and those cultural ideals lived on. It turns out that sex, aggression, and pleasure are not competitive and conducive to economic growth and are thus looked down upon. However, that is what man’s brain is wired for. That is his purpose. Technology goes against the grain of our instincts but is a more scalable lever of organizing entropy. Below is the opening paragraph of The Unabomber’s Manifesto: “ The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.” I think he is correct (not in his actions). Man has lost sight of his purpose and those who are currently “best fit” are those who are adapting to be the most similar to computers. That’s not what we are hardwired for. By harnessing entropy through science, technology, and engineering, we have broken the mold. We hit evolutionary escape velocity. Developing AGI could be a disaster for humanity. There is no way to stop this trend of science and truth now that Pandora’s box has been opened. The number of scientists on earth has doubled every 17 years, and we know that humans aren’t great at comprehending exponential growth. This has led to depression, anxiety, and lapses in human mental health. One way to think of depression is to put a mouse in a jar of water. When it stops swimming, that is depression, according to some neuroscientists (Samuel Rodrigues). To me, though, couldn’t the mouse have just gotten tired? Anyways, if we assume this is only in the neurological sense, depression is man submitting to suffering. Saying that the end no longer justifies the means of his suffering. If man has no purpose, then his suffering, in any quantity, is for no reason and he becomes depressed. We see a lot more of this in a world where we increasingly lean on technology. It makes life easier, it removes the end and the means! It has taken the resistance out of daily life. It has us sitting on the sidelines, it has stolen our purpose. While everyone is worried about the singularity of artificial general intelligence, I contend that it happened when man became able to reason, but AGI will be the significant point of inflection. Love this quote by detective Rust Cohle of True Detective, “ I'd consider myself a realist, alright? But in philosophical terms I'm what's called a pessimist... I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution. We became too self-aware. Nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself - we are creatures that should not exist by natural law... We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self, that accretion of sensory experience and feelings, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybody's nobody... I think the honorable thing for our species to do is to deny our programming. Stop reproducing, walk hand in hand into extinction - one last midnight, brothers and sisters opting out of a raw deal.” A “pig in a cage on antibiotics.” <div id='rg_embed_link_139773' class='rg_embed_link' data-song-id='139773'>Read <a href='https://genius.com/Radiohead-fitter-happier-lyrics'>“Fitter Happier” by Radiohead</a> on Genius</div> <script crossorigin src='//genius.com/songs/139773/embed.js'></script> Courtesy of ChatGPT (how ironic), here is the summary of the song in this context: Some listeners see the lyrics as exploring themes of technological advancement, the erosion of individual freedom, and the loss of authenticity in modern life. The imagery of a pig in a cage on antibiotics can be seen as a metaphor for the way that modern society often forces individuals into restrictive and unnatural circumstances, while at the same time trying to alleviate suffering through technology and medicine. Overall, the song can be seen as a commentary on the human condition in a rapidly changing world, and the ways in which the relentless pursuit of progress can sometimes lead to negative consequences. By exploring these themes, the song invites listeners to reflect on the state of society and their own experiences, and to question whether the direction of progress is truly positive. Technology somewhat paradoxically improved the standard of living while also suppressing fulfillment. Just as it is harmful to dry fire a bow, we are living lives we were not meant to live. Religion was a temporary band-aid. It is the same reason that people think they are giving their dogs their best life with treats, sweaters, and plush dog beds, but I contend the dogs who hunt with their owners are the most fulfilled as they are striving for goals aligned with their instincts. “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.” - Nietzche Optimism - Technological growth I got a bit pessimistic at the end there. The truth is that we still have much room for growth. There are more opportunities per capita as a result of technological advancement than ever before. Growth and innovation increases human equity and liberty. In the next essay, I will make a case for what the purpose of life is, given the aforementioned genetic restraints. In the long-term, I see no reason why man could not simply program a meaning to life into his brain. A quick and dirty solution, but one that would work. Conclusion Human beings are hardwired to expand and grow their influence. The manner in which to do that has historically been in ways that aligned with our instincts. Now, we have hit evolutionary escape velocity through logic and computation. While this can be depressing to some, it also enables humans to live creative and fulfilled lives in a new way. In the next essay, we will navigate the more optimistic benefits of technological advancement and determining the meaning of life. Thanks for reading Engineering the Future!

"BMS backing for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-spotting AI – Another in a wave of companies using ECG and ML to sus out minute changes in patients ECGs which are fingerprints of a crime scene that represent a greater change in the patient conditions. Notably, Apple also announced last week that they were moving closer to developing a non-invasive glucose . This is highly doubtful. This is what I had worked on in college, using ECG signal data to pin down changes in electrolytes broadly. While I believe its possible, the accuracy needed for diabetics is likely not going to be achieved in a long time. - You only have to look at Fierce Biotech’s Layoff Tracker to see that 2022 was a grim year for biotechs. How grim? Well, only a fifth of the 532 small cap biotech stocks tracked by Evaluate Vantage ended up on the year, “with many trading below cash,” according to the market insights company’s latest report. Despite a “year of deep declines” in share prices, it was a recovery among big cap companies in the final quarter that saved biopharma from “disaster” in 2022, Evaluate said. This $567 billion surge in combined market cap for the 11 biggest pharmas recovered almost six months’ worth of losses, the authors noted. Leading the big cap cavalry charge was Novo Nordisk, followed by Moderna, Gilead and BeiGene. I think this is interesting, because it relates to something that others have said that was something that has confused me. It seems that biotech equities offers both counter-cyclical hedging as healthcare is always needed and people are always getting sick, but in a high interest rate environment, hedge funds rotate out of the riskier biotechs. Pharma offers the stability and risk aversion with the counter-cyclical revenues. – I spent some time speaking to people at incubators in Chicago such as mHUB and MATTER. At the time, people were very bullish and purposefully looking to set up Chicago as a medtech ecosystem. I was skeptical. Chicago has the least innovative culture you can imagine. Perhaps if Zuck sees something, there could be a big move of biotech to Chicago. But seems they’re focusing on devices in this push. “This institute will embark on science to embed miniaturized sensors into tissues that will allow us to understand how healthy and diseased tissues function in unprecedented detail,” Priscilla Chan, M.D., said in the release, adding that improving that understanding will give researchers a better idea of “what goes wrong in disease and how to fix it.” Regardless, this is great, it levels with last week’s theme of the need for precision data FIRST, before we can make advancements in biotech. We need the data to hand the complexity off to computers, which can back into the solutions we need to advance biotech. – Loneliness shrinks the brain and leads to actual problems in development. Loneliness area fires up in a certain part of the brain called the default network. It is not linked to the amygdala as many had previously thought. Experiments reveal that loneliness is more of a feeling of rejection rather than anything else and should be considered a feeling of deprivation like hunger or thirst. After a certain amount of time, people gravitate back towards social. I don’t actually have a great grasp of this, but seems like they are developing these below (polymer structures that absorb significantly more water than their mass) for neurons to grow on like vines on a fence. Neurons are not regenerative so hydrogels are being used to revert cancer cells to stem cells in less than 24 hours. – Using bats as a blueprint for human immunity"
"Abstraction vs First Principles At the beginning of the year, I was really interested in two ideas: Abstraction and First Principles. These both are necessary modes of thinking for human beings, but they often counter each other. I will say that I went looking and looked very hard. The only ultimate truth I found is that there are no ultimate truths. I can’t really imagine a brain that could only do one or the other, they are both necessary. When I think about abstraction, to me it means creating heuristics or rules about a collection of data points. It is a practice of pattern recognition, extrapolation or interpolation or however the brain works that I don’t understand. Humans are simple creatures, and we package these heuristics into symbols that we reference for later use. Convolutional Neural Networks Work Similarly There is also the idea of first principles, which is zooming in on each of the data points and questioning our overarching theories. Since these heuristics are imperfect, they can cause misinterpretations or miss out on key nuances. It is necessary for an engineer to approach problems in first principles, and we should approach problems in fields like literature and politics all the same. Tend to First Principles – The Resource Tradeoff First principles is theoretically the best course of action. But we are faced with resource and time constraints, so humans often defer to abstraction or mimetically deferring to others assumptions. It would be hard to imagine waking up and efficiently going to work every day without having these unquestioned, instinctual behaviors. Problems Due to Abstraction - Rules were meant to be broken. Many problems in our society are due to deferring to symbols of understanding and abstraction. If you think about it, the Constitution is largely used for the purpose of setting standard laws that should remain true over time, while leaving room for change. As the country evolves over millennia, some of these are going to become outdated. Many heuristic dissolve over time. We maybe understand that we like a certain ideology and so we vote for a party that falls under the abstraction of democrat or conservative. That’s not why we vote though? The party is just a way to divide a spectrum of policies into two buckets. However, many don’t really investigate whether the candidate’s stance mirrors their own. Further, these stances might be cloudy takes that don’t address the real problem. “I am going to stop all wars” avoids the perfectly reasonable fact that wars are sometimes necessary to survive. Politics is plagued by this issue because the population of interest / target market you are selling to isn’t knowledgeable. Democracy has its flaws. In chess, we make rules like keep the knights in the center of the board, get rooks on open lines and control the center. Play chess against a computer engine, Magnus, Kasparov or Tal and you will see powerful counterintuitive moves. A dim knight on the rim has made my life miserable on multiple occasions. Similarly in business, you may learn general rules like never compromise on hires, the customer is always right, and to always align all stakeholders. Just to make an example with one of these, the customer is not always right. Every Situation is Unique I think the largest realization I’ve had recently is that I spend so much time learning from others from any source I can find, looking desperately for “ultimate truths of business.” Business isn’t mathematics. The reality is there are no ultimate truths of business. Every industry, person, and problem is inherently distinct. A quote that I will reapply from Peter Thiel here is, “The next Bill Gates will not start an operating system. The next Larry Page won't start a search engine. The next Mark Zuckerberg won't start a social network company. If you are copying these people, you are not learning from them.” Heuristics are still helpful. Jeff Bezos used two heuristics that generally hold up. The assumption that customers will always want their items to arrive faster and cheaper. And that if you improve on those two metrics you can never go wrong. Working hard tends to be pretty good advice as well. I’ve spent a lot of time learning from those who have found success in software and finance, but I think that the necessary next step is to unlearn many lessons and create my own framework that will work well for me. This problem goes much deeper and permeates how we think about everything I think this problem is sneakily much larger than even the above lets off. Humans are goal- and purpose-oriented creatures. The problem is that humans no longer use religion as the great north star of our internal compass, we fill it with other concepts or identities. Whether that is to be a good person, to get rich, to be a good student, etc. These questions actually get infinitely complex when you break them down into cells and atoms. What is the essence of why we actually want to get rich? Why do we work? What does it mean to be a good person and whose ethical framework do we want to abide by? Is being a good person dependent on what we do in the moment or do the ends justify the means? Once again, if we were actually original in every way of life, it would be paralyzing to try to analyze everything, so we rely upon heuristics. People often look to others who have become rich and try to emulate their strategies. The problem is that these strategies may not always work the same in the next generation. In the gold rush, wall street boom, internet bubble, the software revolution, and now crypto and AI, these waves are idiosyncratic and distinct in their own ways. We can keep saying that we’re in the next internet software revolution, and that’s a helpful way to think about it, but that same playbook will never work perfectly again. The founders that compete well in each wave also have different skill sets and personalities. Within those waves, there are different types of businesses that are born, which require different lines of thinking. Being different is your asset, not a liability. There are things we can learn from each of these instances, but no time is ever the exact same. Possibly, the only constant is to be different, unique, individual, and rather than shape to the crowd, shape to the problems you face. Dig Deeper So, when you say you want to get rich, what does that mean? Does having money allow you a lifestyle that you can live, or people you can associate with? Does it buy you your time? If you view money to buy you time, what would you do with that time? Why not just do that right now? When people say they want to be an entrepreneur, what they are often saying is “I want to be rich and famous,” because there is a certain image of an entrepreneur that we have as a society. I’m trying to just touch grass more, looking internally rather than externally. After I graduated high school, even though I was interested in science, I studied finance, because I wanted to start businesses and make money, only to find out that you can start many different types of businesses and that finance isn’t really a necessary skill to start businesses. It’s just a skill to understand the flow of capital—“business” is a broadly stroked blanket abstraction that hides the fact that each business is unique. You can start an infinite number of businesses with different business models. I looked outward. Now I ended up in biotech anyways and boy would that science degree have been helpful… I then matriculated into investment banking because at the University of Illinois, it seemed like the only available class of people who went on to be successful. A problem of availability bias that I then pegged to my understanding of the world. Once there, I realized that my personality is not one that fits in well. I was trying to fit a square box in a round hole. How to Approach Problems? What became apparent in my first real job, which is both a strength and a weakness is I don’t like convention—I like the big picture. Banking was extremely process oriented and rooted in convention, in addition to requiring granular attention to detail for things that I often that were de minimus . It’s interesting, if you ask someone who works in banking at another company, their day-to-day always almost completely reflects yours—managing trackers, making profiles, etc. The industry is mature and quite set in its ways. There was a lot that I learned from it, but I have always been someone who tries to fully understand every angle, possibility, the essence of a problem and think through the best way forward, then executing. The thing that constantly hurt me was having certain boxes I needed to check without anyone really questioning or understanding why we were checking them, and then having to execute quickly constantly, without having much time to question the process. I never liked school for this reason, and it felt like my first job was to do homework professionally. I have been increasingly changing my view of the world to one of nuance. Maybe partly due to growing up with multiple choice questions, I had begun to believe the world had answers and they were determinate. The earth is a giant ball of confusion, and it is an infinitely multi-dimensional gradient. This is of course a super hard way to conceptualize problems, but that’s exactly how they all work. Problems are faced with multiple input variables, multiple output variables, entropy, irrationality, non-linearity, etc. Now, instead of picking a heuristic, I try to identify multiple opposing modes of thought and wrestle on the gradient between them. I try to question convention. Don’t listen to convention. Color outside the lines. They’re often set arbitrarily. For instance, the heuristic I previously mentioned has two takes: (1) the customer is always right and (2) if Ford asked a customer for what they wanted they would have said faster horses. (1) Some say the idea doesn’t matter and startups are about execution, but (2) of course the idea matters because there are constraints and different sized pockets of value that may never work. We shouldn’t defer to optimism or pessimism; we should be both a hardcore optimist and pessimist and constantly wrestle between the two. We shouldn’t be an insider or an outsider, both have advantages at different times. We shouldn’t be either creative or purely executive, we should wander between the two, there are times for both. There are many permutations of the above. We must recognize them, like different lines of play in chess, and see as far out as reasonable possible. There are heuristics that help us approach uncertainty, but we shouldn’t rely on them. I hope to live my life not choosing binary modes of action, but by seeing n variables of the spectrum and strategically straddling the line, finding the global point of maximization. I don’t actually know where I was going with this or if I characterized it well."
"In 2019, I thought culture was piñatas, Sauerkraut, football Sundays, and Christmas. Some ritual thing people do for whatever reason that didn’t interest me. In 2020, I thought culture was what Deloitte and Protiviti would present to kids on campus, ping pong tables in the office and maybe one day even a high-5 from your boss. In 2021, I thought about the differences between the other students on campus and I. I started thinking about my own values and beliefs, and how it was different from others. I had always had these beliefs, but for some reason as a kid you don’t really understand differences in people, and that you can be both different and have merit. In 2022, I started drafting up my visions for culture for 2 startups I was building on campus. From this experimentation, I was able to see what worked and what didn’t. In 2023, I was working my first big boy job. I had now felt the full force of culture and how it would impact every second of every day and how I made decisions and behaved amongst the group. In 2024, I work both at Shaper Capital (parent company) and with separate portfolio companies, observing and realizing that every company culture is different and it’s not something that is easily changed. I came to the understanding that culture is the set of behaviors, principles, values, and understanding that act as a backdrop to every decision that has been and will be made at the company. — Culture is Important If I plot these annual points, I realize that where I once believed culture was a trivial aspect of a business, I now believe culture is the most important part of a company . It feels hard to even just call it a “part” of a company, because culture is the company and the company is the culture bottled into a solidified institution. I will likely be even more focused on culture the more I understand it. Before you work in a company, or start one, you likely have an abstract idea of what a company is. When you think of Nike, you probably just have some idea of their brand and the products they provide to the world. After you spend time with companies and look real close at them, you start to realize that, yes, companies are vehicles for providing value to the world, but some imperfect human being created that company and its process. Moreover, every new product, decision to enter a new market, design choice, quality issue, and happy hour are a product of the decisions and behavior of the company’s people and processes. Companies are organisms that live, breathe, adapt, mutate, and die just as their cells (employees) and organs (departments and teams). My observations on culture from both the perspective of the company and the employee. Ideally, I will also start to define some sort of framework on my own beliefs for what a “good” culture looks like. What is Culture? We should properly define culture if we are going to ascribe so much importance to it. Culture, while a fuzzy concept, is defined by Joel Mokyr in A Culture of Growth as the below: “Culture is a set of beliefs, values, and preferences, capable of affecting behavior, that are socially (not genetically) transmitted and that are shared by some subset of society.” He also describes the following terms: Beliefs : statements of factual nature to the state of the world Values : statements about society and social relations (often thought about as ethics and ideology) Preferences : statements about individual affairs such as consumption and personal affairs Individual Culture Individualism If you introspect, you have a set of beliefs, values, and preferences that you may have had a predisposition for genetically, were transferred vertically from your parents, and learned from a variety of experiences/data points throughout your life, but mostly picked up through imitation and choice of a menu from the people you were surrounded by. Humans are sheep. Your unique combination of beliefs, values, and preferences are now deeply embedded in your personality. Some of these can be changed and influenced, others are much harder to. Depending on the age, plasticity of the individual’s brain, openness to new ideas, agreeableness, interest, etc. My framework for this, as referenced in my last essay, is that (1) we develop an idea of what the world is and how it functions from an objective standpoint, (2) we create meaning from this into our beliefs, values, and preferences, and (3) ultimately act in accordance with those beliefs. Your “Why” Throughout your life, you have probably gravitated towards different ideas and different groups of thought. You may have found that some activities never made sense to you the same way they made sense to others. You may have found that in some environments you thrived and some environments you struggled. Some cultures are painful as you are forced to act in ways that go against the grain of your individual belief system and some feel as natural as breathing. You should always try to be in the latter culture. My observation through high school, the University of Illinois, and even now is that a surprisingly small % of people are truly intrinsically motivated and beat to their own drum. Of this population, the smaller yet % of the population has a “why” that intersects with yours, you get along with, and has the necessary skills to actually accomplish what you want to accomplish. Those people would be interested in a topic even if you didn’t force them to be. They have a “why”, a purpose, a sparkle in the eye. They know why they are speaking with you. They are excited by a blank sheet of paper and by the prospect of filling it with ideas. They have a north star and their natural state is progressing towards it. These people don’t need micromanaging. They understand the broader direction of their life, why what you are working on is important in that light, how to accomplish it, and what that means for what they should be spending their time on at any moment. This person is aligned. My personal view is if I have enough money to be comfortable, my own internal test is that I want to be doing what I would be doing as if money didn’t matter, because it doesn’t. More specifically, this probably means growth and that usually comes from being all-in working on important problems with smart people I admire. Any other combination of variables means my function for growth/time is not optimized. This is also why I feel the value of colleges is not only the content of the courses. The majority of the value of colleges is being surrounded by the smartest people of diverse belief systems so that you pick up their traits and learn from them, subjecting yourself to purposeful mimeticism. My function for growth is inwardly focused, rather than an accumulation of material things or money. I would make the bet that if you want to make a lot of money, your function should still be inwardly optimized. The best way to make a million dollars is to become the type of person who can make a million dollars. Variation That is just my view of individual culture. Different systems will work for different people and different problems. Some thrive in a different environment. I used to wonder why people work jobs that pay well but people don’t like to do them. They disconnect their intrinsic motivation from work. They understand the transaction they are making. They give up their time and receive money in return. Many big law / finance professionals leave their life at the door when they clock in. There are exceptional people of all shapes, sizes, and motivations. The problem doesn’t arise when you have different cultures, it’s when you have people working in the wrong workplace culture. Anything forced is suboptimal. Exceptional People & Aptitude Ultimately, it is not enough to just believe and work hard. While that is probably the most important part, there is a very real sense that aptitude matters. Can you actually build the damn thing? Do you have the experience and intelligence to arrive at the right solution? It is also true that exceptionalism breeds exceptionalism. Iron sharpens iron. There is this phrase that’s used, cultural density, that I like. The idea that there are people who can provide 50x the value of an average person is used in and that with that in mind it’s not a problem to pay them more. Exceptionalism spreads slowly and mediocrity spreads quickly. You notice that in startups as soon as you lose momentum it is hard to pick it back up. When I founded , this was something that intuitively made sense to me. The power law of talent, that the top 1-5 students in algorithmic trading / quantitative finance from each university could drive significantly higher returns than the top 30 from UIUC. Smart and ambitious people also like working with other smart and ambitious people, you just need to connect them and direct them towards an important goal. It is possible that the last real alpha left is in finding exceptional people as human focus is the most valuable commodity on planet earth. A question of what is more important, culture or talent, is hard to answer. What is more important, attitude or aptitude? Can you have a good culture with bad people? Can you have a bad culture with good people? My guess is that attitude is more important, my life is just a giant bet that grit and determination are more valuable than intelligence, but of course you need both. Institutions Cultural Vehicles One person working alone aligns with their individual culture. As you begin grouping people together to function, you are creating a cultural institution. Within the category of institutions, I will focus specifically on companies. Companies are necessary vehicles of change. You cannot often create sufficient change alone. You cannot be successful in a vacuum. You need other people rowing in the same direction as you. You can’t all be rowing in separate directions, as you will then never arrive anywhere meaningful. As Mokyr puts it, “At some level, all evolutionary and cultural systems must have such a system in place, to lend some modicum of stability to existing beliefs and prevent complete chaos.” From my observation, this is a direct parallel to how a company scales. Often, when starting a company, you are doing . Then, you need to put in place processes and rules to make a machine that scales. You lose the beauty and nuance of the initial product but it allows you to create a repeatable product and process. Think customized research for a client to creating art. You can’t really do these things at scale. Starting companies isn’t actually that hard, it’s building the culture and lean mechanical processes that’s hard. Two people combine their cultural values, beliefs, and perspectives to work on something. There is inevitably conflict and misalignment in these as two sets of beliefs are never the same. Add a third, and you again will need to make rational choices and forge social contracts on how you will behave. People will make sacrifices. There is a healthy amount of conflict. If you add someone with too many different beliefs, they will be rejected by the system, be influenced, or be forced to integrate. Setting Culture It is really difficult to set a culture from the top down because it is really the combination of beliefs, values, preferences that the institution aligns and agrees upon. It does feel like there needs to be someone who sets and protects the company culture. I sometimes feel like that is the most important job of the CEO. Reflexivity & Cults There is a curious nature of these organizations as they become a living, breathing organism. They have a reflexive nature where the culture influences the institution and the institution in turn influences the culture. As institutions grow mature, they lose their flexibility and the culture becomes more entrenched, which is good for stability at the detriment of agility. It doesn’t matter what executive changes Coca-Cola puts in place. Their complex web of incentives, hierarchy, goals, and international stake is extremely difficult to untangle. Humans have some imitative qualities that make it really hard to go against the grain. We also have instincts that make it difficult to challenge authority. I struggle with this and it makes me avoidant. It makes perfect sense, if you challenged authority for much of history and popped your head above the crowd, you would have had it chopped off. I wrote about (cult)ure in 2022 in my essay “ .” I noticed two things: People have a natural tendency to look to the leader / point of authority. You also notice this trickle-down effect in meetings. As a leader, you must carefully exercise when you speak and what you say as it will have a lot of collateral effects. I’ve noticed some leaders purposely refrain, which forces independent thought, and this seems super effective. “I’ll start this section by saying the most surprising thing about starting these organizations was the fact that people kept looking to me for what to do. I’m an idiot, what do I know? You start seeing that what you say in meetings rubs off on people and hear them recite them in conversations with another person. It’s still really odd to me, but it does make sense. People join because they are often excited about what you are building. They don’t know the full story and look to the builder for guidance. Over time, this process becomes more natural and a corporate culture begins to develop.” When you create a company, you want the culture to be insulated. I firmly believe that any company I start, we will spend all our time together IN PERSON. I don’t think anyone could sway my opinion on this. You need to maintain cohesion and there is a strong sense of community and trust you get from working together. “Maintaining that cohesion and focus within a group is vital. Concentrating that focus in one space prevents leakage when members wander into the dilutive atmosphere that is daily life, which has too many distracting moving parts and a disorderly focus on the ‘daily thing.’” Incentives Often the nuts and bolts that keep things stable in institutions are its incentive systems. You need someone to lead the product and specifically assign them a few KPIs such as user engagement to accomplish. With this North Star/Endpoint, the employee works backwards to meet it. You may have structured compensation and feedback on this goal. Incentives are what ultimately determine a person’s actions, despite what they may say. It is human nature. If incentives are improperly set, they can create deviant behavior that is not beneficial for the system. Consider the paperclip AI problem: “Philosophers have speculated that an AI tasked with a task such as creating paperclips might cause an apocalypse by learning to divert ever-increasing resources to the task, and then learning how to resist our attempts to turn it off.” The fear here is that the simple incentive to create paperclips may set off a change of events that ultimately engulfs the entire universe. Cultural Change Marketplace of Ideas and Cultural Evolution In the exploration of what caused the Industrial Revolution, Joel Mokyr discusses how culture changes. This is somewhat difficult to quantify, but two models are referenced for how cultural change occurs, the Evolutionary Model of ideas, the Marketplace of Ideas and the Choice-Based Cultural Model. It is the least likely that cultural changes are just genetic, it is also unlikely that culture is only passed down from your parents vertically. It is more likely that throughout life we are presented with a marketplace of ideas, in other words a cultural menu, that we choose from. This enables faster transmission of ideas. I’ve also written before about the systems and moral structures that exist are the systems that win and persist. The rules and history is written by the victors. For instance, while communism always seems to present itself as an attractive option on the cultural menu to the majority, it just doesn’t fare that well in the face of evolution. Biases The effect of “biases” determines how likely an individual is to adopt a belief, value, or preference. How convincing is it? How much do you want to believe it? People sometimes just believe what they want to believe. If you think about society today, a significant amount of change occurs through the rapid information transmission that occurs through social media, the news, and influencers. In China, coercion bias may be more relevant. Fortunately as well, we live in a time that adopts belief based on empirical evidence. Obviously not always but more than in the past. Content-Based Bias: Which seems to be best supported by evidence? Direct Bias: Society appoints points of authority who pick the ideas. Consistency + Confirmation Bias: People choose values that are consistent or aligned with existing beliefs. If you believe the Earth is flat, you will have more difficulty accepting heliocentrism. Model-Based Bias: People imitate role models. Rhetorical Bias: Some charismatic people are simply better at persuading the crowd. Frequency Dependent Bias: People believe what the majority of people around them believe. Rationalization Bias: Culture is changed or maintained by the institutions. I.e. the church calling something a sin or a University taking a stance on a topic. Coercion Bias: Cultural beliefs are affected by force. Salient Event Bias: highly traumatic events lead the population to take a stance. I.e. global financial crisis and the public’s view on regulating Wall Street. Cultural Entrepreneurs Society also sometimes has instances where a single figure’s stance. The importance of cultural entrepreneurs is debated. Would the change have happened without their agency? Maybe, but there seems to be some role. To me, this is Balaji in Network States. Peter Thiel for the idea that every great company happens once. They likely have done some form of repackaging but it still draws attention to the idea. Note that there is statistically significant evidence that the majority of cultural change comes from the small minority in the elite. Fragmentation & Competition Some environments are more conducive to competition of ideas. Are the powers-that-be more fragmented and forced to compete with different ideas. Changing Company Culture I have seen 4 separate takes on changing culture after the fact. Break and Reorder : It is possible to take a company, break it, and reorder it, while cultivating true internal believers to set sail in a new direction. I wouldn’t have thought so before. In retrospect, there is probably a set of boxes that need to be checked to make sure this arrangement would work, are you aligned? Healthy Conflict : There is a healthy amount of conflict in company culture. In other words, it is a feature, not a bug, that people push and pull on issues. This tug-of-war causes people to truly assess multiple perspectives and through healthy discussion arrive at the best decision, rather than falling into a local maxima. Separate Cultures : Creating separate cultures and organizations that operate relatively independently within a larger institution. You can also cross-pollinate by adding a few high-level people to both sides. Thiel’s law : A startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed. There is a very real aspect that I have seen in some people where you can simply not change them or they fail to adapt. Not only this, but as a company reaches maturity, the incentives and processes are so deeply embedded that they may not be able to change. Culture of Growth Historical There was a major shift that occurred between 1500-1700 that put the world on a course it would never return from via the Industrial Revolution. The book makes the argument that boils the change down into the growth of useful knowledge and a shift in Attitude accompanied by Aptitude of the populace. Bacon presented the belief that useful knowledge can have an impact on growth. Then, Newton proved it through his work. Society became believers in technological progress. Ultimately, the church and luddism lost the fight. Society now believed technological progress to be booth possible and good. I think we are seeing a projection of this trend in recent years with the e/acc movement that technological progress is not just good but moral and necessary . Elon Musk presents his grabs for power and fame with the face that they are good for humanity. Company Growth Traits You should assume that there are an infinite combination of beliefs and values that a company can present. Each combination is right for different industries and strategies. There is no perfect formula. Ideally a company strategy is designed to maximize profits. It will need to organize itself in a way that optimizes for attracting talent, builds a great product, learns a lot of useful information, and can tell a lot of people about its product. What traits are these exactly? There will be a lot here, but some of the traits that are listed in the book are: Trust - Do you have trust that others are acting in your best interest? Alignment - are you rowing in the same direction? (agree to disagree and commit) Individualism over Collectivism & Property Rights - Are you rewarded for your work Egalitarian - Are there equal opportunities for all? Meritocratic - (is the best output rewarded) Growth is possible and good - Attitude and belief (necessary optimism) Industriousness - Do people work really hard Enforceable contracts - Are the rules clear and enforced Low rate of rent seeking - Low bureaucracy and politics Useful knowledge - learning leads to useful knowledge which leads to growth and also should be considered an investment in human capital Time preference and delayed gratification - do you have the capacity for patient investments into the future Risk - do you encourage risk-taking behavior? Irreverence - do you go against the authority Irreverence is the most difficult one, but seems to be highlighted by Mokyr the A Culture of Growth as one of the most important aspects of innovation. You need to have some sort of distrust in the system. I’ll dig more into this in the next section. I would be really interested in plotting the above points starting in 1400 to today. Growth in useful knowledge has gone through the roof. Trust has largely increased. Time preference seems to not have changed much due to consumerism. Irreverence is completely restrained. There is significant rent-seeking behavior. People really don’t work that hard on average. More people believe in the future but not that many. Society is relatively meritocratic but on misaligned incentives such as test scores that determine the future of our children. And we aren’t aligned on any common goals for the future. We are also highly individualist. Egalitarianism is relatively good but those from poor socioeconomic backgrounds are extremely disadvantaged. At a time when the growth of useful knowledge is expanding exponentially, which leads to increased opportunities for growth, society has bred citizens who aren’t irreverent or hard working enough to pursue them. A uniquely good culture of growth, the people who are extremely smart, industrious, trustworthy, irreverent, and believe in technological progress. Perspective of the Employee In addition to making money, many employees want to feel that their work matters. Employees are human beings. We question our purpose on Earth and whether it is worth our time. The leader should always convey benevolence to their employees, even if the pragmatic decisions to build the business are the most important, and the message conveyed is sold or repackaged with a different bias or framing to accomplish what is in the best interest of the company. “When the general regards his troops as young children, they will advance into the deepest valleys with him. When he regards his troops as his beloved children, they will be willing to die with him.” - Sun-tzu Napoleon was alongside his troops on the battlefield. In addition to feeling that an employee matters, they should be given the opportunity to grow. Societies that don’t grow erupt into internal strife. As I mentioned, when I am not able to grow, I become frustrated. The employee will ultimately ask the question “why am I here?” They should have a clear answer for this. The manager should regularly check in with the employee to make sure the arrangement is working. The employee should share a common information base, when feasible. Common direction and data makes it easier for the employee to make micro-decisions every day and also feel that they are a part of the overall organization. Compensation Not all compensation is money. How do you encourage and compensate someone who doesn’t care about money? You will need to pay them in other ways. Irreverence “If the culture is heavily infused with respect and worship of ancient wisdom so that any intellectual innovation is considered deviant and blasphemous, technological creativity will be similarly constrained. irreverence is a key to progress” If I introspect, my strongest character traits (both weaknesses and strengths) are deep irreverence / distrust in current systems coupled with curiosity. The problem is this has never been an asset throughout my life. Any system in which I have partaken has rejected irreverent behavior and I have been extremely disadvantaged. Teachers hated me. I don’t do well with the process. I can’t follow instructions. I don’t care about convention. I don’t work well under others. The only work that I have excelled at is my own. While this ability to think differently isn’t rewarded by most institutions, it is rewarded by growth and new opportunity in the frontier, where there are no conventions, there is just open white space. But how do you employ these people? You give them rope, align their incentives, and keep them in check, and get rid of me if I don’t work out, fair. That’s the risk of meritocratic, non-beaurocratic institutions. You can grow, but you can also sputter out. I am reminded of one of my favorite Nietzsche quotes: “when young men are ready to be sent out into the ""desert,"" they are instead put into safe bureaucracies. They are ""estranged from themselves"" - the heat of their youth left cold. ""Daily toil"" becomes your opium and your edge is permanently blunted”. This is what academic and research institutions lost. You can’t be a mad scientist anymore or you won’t get funded. Creativity is drained from the youth as soon as they set foot in elementary school. OKRs & Growth These seem like an effective way to create clarity around “what success looks like” and then for the talented employee to connect the ambiguous dots and back into their end goal using whatever methods that make most sense to them. This allows the individual to grow at their own pace. Compared to traditional companies where you grow at the pace of the linear career path. Even better, in the best company, you grow at your fastest path and when you reach plateaus, your organization helps you break through them. The company can also push the employee as a part of the social contract. Humans are inherently lazy, but we can enter ourselves into difficult things. Men are not afraid of pain, they can endure any suffering for an end they are interested in. Perspective of the Company For the company, it is also in the long-term interest of growth to develop employees internally. But at the end of the day, it is the employer's interest to pay the employee the smallest fee possible to do work. The employer oftentimes knows how they want the work done as well. There is no creativity encouraged because, frankly, it’s not that helpful. However, if you understand one thing. That thing is that human focus is Earth’s most valuable commodity. And that focus is best spent on what the person is interested in and has the freedom to pursue, you understand that the major arbitrage opportunity exists in extremely smart intrinsically motivated people who fare well with white space. In a good situation, the employer’s and employee’s interests are well balanced into a social contract that is a Win-Win. Some companies are central planning machines (Apple) because they know what must be done and want to do it repeatedly, some are more of a learning machine. There is a balance of libertarianism and authoritarianism you need to strike when creating a company culture to accomplish a certain goal. Politics Be wary of rent-seekers and politicians. Culture as an Investment Culture is the passive investment vehicle of a leader. Imagine you instill a strong culture and go on vacation for a week. The employees would act as if you were there. Ideally, you could one day depart the company and there would be no problems. This is what happens when you take a step back and build culture from the outset. Conclusion Company culture is super important."
"Intro We are living in the best time to be a Founder in history. IBM, founded in 1896, took 45 years to reach a billion 2020 dollars in revenue. Hewlett-Packard, founded in 1939, took 25 years. Microsoft, founded in 1975, took 13 years. Now the norm for fast-growing companies is 7 or 8 years. This trend will only accelerate (Paul Graham). With the breakup of some of the largest companies and increased access to technology, there has never been a better time to start a business as a young entrepreneur, and the decades to come will be filled with infinite opportunity. With that said, entrepreneurship will always be incredibly difficult. Entrepreneurship is an ardent example of a process that must be learned by doing. The reason for this is that entrepreneurship is too broad and the experience is tailored to the entrepreneur (everyone has their own style). Entrepreneurship is a mindset. It is the task of accomplishing one’s goals with constrained resources. Experience will vary, each industry has its own sets of challenges, and each entrepreneur has their own tool kit to solve them. Over the course of the last year forming a quantitative investment manager and a software-as-a-medical device startup, more lessons have been thrown at me than I’ve been able to field. The lessons carry over into other fields of entrepreneurship. Many may seem obvious, but for some reason they needed to be experienced and written down to be fully logged into memory. These lessons simply cannot be learned from reading (sorry). They must be learned first-hand and ingrained in the mind of a Founder so they can intuit around future problems. Written below are 7 of the many lessons that I’ve learned over the last year, many can be applied generally, but most apply to early-stage startups. Co-Founders Often, and especially if you are building a technical product, the most important ingredient to success is who you are building it with. A business partner has to, for the most part, be aligned with your grand vision of what the world should be, and how you are going to build that world. There needs to be a cultural fit and you must get along as if you would be friends outside of work. You are essentially married and may actually spend more time together than would a married couple. With that said, there must be strong trust. You have to be able to say to your Co-Founder, “I fucked up,” be able to go weeks across the country and know that both sides are not letting the other down, and that the other can do their role infinitely better than you would be able. The team building the product is the bridge to its actualization. Any cracks in the team’s foundation will lurk systemically for years to come. There will always be cracks, but they should be addressed at the minimum. This sounds easy, and many may be able to point to people in their network that would make great Co-Founders, but it’s not. The early stages of a startup are unlike working for any company, which I’ll touch on more later. Simply put, navigating a startup to product-market fit is like sailing a ship through a storm, where you need to draw up the map as you go or jumping off a cliff and assembling the airplane mid-fall. Pre-product market fit can be exciting to some and heavily depressing to others. It requires incredibly hard work with no certain outcome. A Co-Founder needs a unique combination of incredulous confidence alongside disarming humility to hold on to snippets of customer validation and technical breakthroughs while pivoting around dead ends. Arguably, the most important character trait found in a Co-Founder is the hardest to pin down. Often, people just have “it.” You may be able to see a sparkle in their eye during an interview. I personally think it comes down to their “why.” Why do you do what you do? Many float through life doing what they think they should be doing and it’s hard for anyone to escape this aspect of the human condition, but some have a rock-solid foundation of who they are, what they believe, and what they want to spend their short time on Earth working on. Those with a glint in their eye know why they’re in the room at that very moment and they are beyond excited to tell you. For those familiar with the Big-5 personality test, these are those categorized by strong openness to experience. These are the people that are excited by an empty white board, because they want to fill it. These are the people that build in their free time, because they enjoy it. These are the people you need to snag up as fast as you can find them, because they are desperately rare. AirBNB famously waited for 6 months to onboard its first Co-Founder, it is logarithmically important to find the best people early on as they will be the face of your business as you grow. In scaling, it is also important to be as lean as possible and delegate responsibility downwards as much as possible. Price law states that the square root of the number of employees do 50% of the work. As the company converts from an exploration map to a well-oiled machine, this trend intensifies and there will be increased dilution in the quality of employees. “Processes need to be streamlined so that idiots can run them, because one day they will.” ~ Warren Buffet (Cult)ure & Values One year ago, I thought culture was a buzzword, and that values were a way for large corporations to tout their moral superiority. But this is not the case. I’ll start this section by saying the most surprising thing about starting these organizations was the fact that people kept looking to me for what to do. I’m an idiot, what do I know? You start seeing that what you say in meetings rubs off on people and hear them recite them in conversations with another person. It’s still really odd to me, but it does make sense. People join because they are often excited about what you are building. They don’t know the full story and look to the builder for guidance. Over time, this process becomes more natural and a corporate culture begins to develop. According to Peter Thiel, early to mid-stage startups need to be cult-like, and I am beginning to agree. Startups make money because they are doing something that is non-obvious and creative. For instance, we are developing non-invasive potassium monitoring using ECG/ML. There’s only a handful of people interested in this technology/application in the world, but we are obsessed with it, and we need to be to succeed. In our sense, our cult is a group of people holding strong values and visions of dialysis care that most don’t know or care about. Maintaining that cohesion and focus within a group is vital. Concentrating that focus in one space prevents leakage when members wander into the dilutive atmosphere that is daily life, which has too many distracting moving parts and a disorderly focus on the “daily thing.” It’s a really odd comparison that is drawn here, but it is surprisingly accurate. A corporate culture is really only a written or unwritten set of rules that tells an employee what to do in any scenario–similar to U.S. governing laws, The Bible, etc. More on this in last week's essay, . Diversity of thought is important, but it is more important that everyone in an organization is on the same page. It is crucial that an organization maintains its own cohesive voice. Else, it is just a hodge podge of people doing random things to advance their perception of the corporate agenda. However, if everyone knows exactly what to do in any given scenario, things get done more efficiently and the right things get done. This becomes difficult as an organization grows. At which point, the CEO is texting the COO, who is talking to the VP of Sales, who is emailing employees… And so begins a giant game of telephone where messages become distorted and the workflows get off track. Corporate bylaws and values exist so that the goals are clear even at the lowest rungs of a massive organization. Larry Page and Sergey Brin are famous for implementing a simple “don’t be evil” at Google. With the amount of side projects coming out of Google X, it’s really amazing that nothing bad ever comes up in the news. The same goes for Amazon, where it is known that everything an employee does should be to (1) lower shipping costs and (2) make faster shipping times, things that a customer will always want. It is a simple rule of thumb for all employees to verify before doing anything, and it has worked exceptionally well. Never Repeat Mistakes This one is really obvious, but it shouldn’t be left unsaid. “Never make the same mistake twice” ~ Gustavo Fring. The journey to building anything is rocky and things will hit you in the face. You will always be hit in the face, but paying close attention to “why” you were hit in the face can help you dodge future problems. One reason the best executives get paid the most money is because they make the best decisions using pattern recognition. Their experience is their asset. They are able to navigate new problems based on crystallized wisdom built over decades. As I mentioned in the beginning, these are often things you have to learn by experience. While complex, the human mind is just an inter tangled net of neurons, which is conditioned to build associations with causes and events. The mistakes that a Founder can make are often so painful, that they are lodged in your neural network and you will have a tough time not remembering them. Assuming the reader is young, you have a long road ahead of you. These failures are your assets. As you continue to make mistakes, you are compounding intellectual capital that will be highly valuable throughout your career. This is the reason for my writing this. It helps me think through my experiences and log them for future reference. Managing After one year of managing, I am convinced it is the most difficult skill in business. Some may have a proclivity to learn, but no one is born a good manager. In fact, I’m reluctant to begin this section, because it deserves 100 pages. Maybe it is true that a degree in management or an MBA would prepare someone to organize others, but I highly fucking doubt it. At a high level, managers are organizing others to accomplish goals. This is important, because people vary in every conceivable way: in incentives, skills, perception, experience, goals, priorities, expectations, the list goes on. Personally, my experience has been in managing highly involved students, with many obligations, who are still figuring these facets out, all the while usually in an unpaid capacity as Co-Founders. Managing can be transactional. You need something done, someone else needs money, so you pay them to do it. In this sense, you ensure that said thing will be completed, but it will not be done well. Managing can be through inspiration, where you guide someone to complete something that they are intrinsically motivated to accomplish. In this sense, you can’t ensure that said thing will be completed, but it will be done to the best of the person’s ability. A salary essentially purchases employees’ time and focus, but it is up to hiring and inspiration to ensure that person is intrinsically motivated to put their best work forward. The first part of being a good manager is managing good people. Managers only have so much bandwidth in startups, because they themselves are figuring things out. It is up to the manager to recruit the best people, as described in the first section. These are people that you can trust to do the job without asking, who then proceed to go above and beyond. Essentially, the best way to manage is to not have to manage at all so you can focus on scaling. Only then is it on you to keep the ball rolling. These people are working for you because they believe in what you believe. They have vested interest in the success of your venture because it is also their venture. They chose to allocate their constrained time and talent pursuing a vision alongside you. In some way, they are tying a portion of their life’s purpose to you. They know that this time and effort is valuable and they want to work for a winning team. So in order to inspire those people, you must be a winner–there’s no way around it. And you must set a precedent to work harder than anyone in the entire corporation. The buck starts and stops with the manager. If it’s obvious you are slacking off, the team will question why. Does he not believe in the vision he’s selling us? As soon as questions begin, they linger. Keeping the ball rolling is the most important, because as soon as it slows, it’s hard to speed back up. But momentum can be a strong force if used correctly. You must take responsibility for failures and give out recognition to others for wins. You have to sacrifice yourself for the sake of the startup’s momentum. Facebook is known for having a small team dedicated to accumulating small wins in its nascency. They said it was their greatest innovation. Those wins motivated employees, because they felt that they were a part of a winning team. Again, this is very cultish, but that’s just how startups are. Managing is not going to be the same for any two people. If you try to be Steve Jobs, you will fail, because (guess what) you aren’t Steve Jobs. A mentor of mine admits he’s somewhat militaristic in his leadership style. He recognizes areas of empathy he needs to improve, but it works for him. Lastly, if you as a manager can inspire people to work more than a 40-hour week, that is powerful. The human brain only has so much RAM. Every day, our RAM/attention is pulled in so many different directions. We are distracted by our phones, we want to watch the game, and we have lives outside of work. It’s great that we do, but when our concentration is pulled, our work product suffers. The reality is hard problems require intensive focus and attention. There is a quadratic relationship between focus and speed/work product. In this sense, a 40-hour week is not 2x more productive than a 20-hour week. It’s more. If someone is truly absorbed in a problem to the extent that they own it, they will make remarkable innovations to solve it. Product-Market Fit Really, when you are building a startup, all you are trying to do is find product-market fit and then scale. Build something that people want and then sell it to them. It’s really that simple, but, and we have fallen trap to this as well, it is so easy to get distracted. The #1 reason that startups fail is that they build something no one wants. You may have a group of people telling you that they really like a feature of your software platform, then you tailor it to them, only to find yourself with an unsustainable business 2 years down the line. It may take years just to find product-market fit, but once you do, it’s clearer how to execute on that vision. Another reason people don’t focus on this is that it’s boring and completely unsexy. All you are doing is asking your customers what they want. Then you build a product that is better or cheaper. Ideally, it’s better to have 1,000 people that absolutely love your product than 10,000 that feel meh about it. This boring shuffle to find PMF is the most important and once you know, you know. If you are in healthcare like us, however, you will be met with a barrage of obstacles, gatekeepers, regulators, and an array of incentives that must be met to go to market. I won’t go into the complexity of this, but my suggestion is honestly to just stay away from healthcare. The last thing I’ve noticed is the best companies are product driven companies. This is just what Y Combinator will tell you, but that is because it is incredibly important. Focus on making the best product in the world and the rest will follow. “The Shuffle” Easily, the most frustrating part about building a startup is the shuffle. Really, what a startup does in essence, is create more with less. That is the formula to a successful startup. You have to get something without having anything… That is the recurring conundrum; it is a “chicken and the egg” problem. 10 investors agree to invest, but they may want validation from a lead investor first. The person you need to be successful will work with you only if you are already successful. You can’t afford the regulator pathway until you sell your product, but you can’t sell your product until you receive clearance. This is your every day as a Founder. These can also be thought of as the various gatekeepers of life. In order to please the gatekeepers, they will send you on side quests so that they can let you through. Often, they really do want to let you through, it’s just that the framework of society won’t allow it. Although, sometimes they are actually just assholes, and that is much worse. The only way around the gatekeepers is through marginal progress to a point in which they cut you some slack. I like to think about this as a marginal cost alongside a step function. You need to inch towards progress until that gatekeeper lets you in. At which point, you need to immediately work on getting through the next gate. Appeasing the gatekeeper comes down to sales. I’m not particularly good at this part, because I’m not one to talk up my projects, but it is something you must do. That’s why contemporary startups are just putting lipstick on a pig, raising for $100 million, then burning cash until you find a viable business model at 1/10th of projections. What it Takes The truth is that being a Founder/CEO is actually pretty shitty. It seems like no one ever talks about that. Nobody discusses how difficult it is to be absorbed by a certain idea you have to sell for potentially 5+ years (if successful) with no breaks and if you let off the gas, you fail. No one can take that responsibility from you because you are navigating new land. There are no other people out there that know your market and business like you. Founder depression has been coined and is common in the Valley. As the leader, it is your job to put out all fires, be on call all the time, work every day to set a precedent for your team, be exceptional, show no weaknesses, and ultimately win. As a founder, you really don’t have any time to explore personal interests, because you have so much responsibility. You never run out of things on your plate, because you don’t have just a plate, you run the entire kitchen. You are responsible for things that are completely out of your control. If someone 2 steps removed from you in the organization isn’t performing, you are responsible for sorting that out. If the OEM sets a new price that is unsustainable for growth, you are responsible for navigating a replacement. Everything under your corporate umbrella that happens (even if under someone else’s role) is your responsibility, and you go down with the ship if milestones aren’t met. I truly have not seen a successful Founder that has not worked impossibly hard–to the point that it is honestly pretty unhealthy. If you want to beat the next guy, you simply need to work 2x as hard, and that may mean 100-hour weeks. The problem is that before you embark into entrepreneurship, you need to be 100% certain that this is something you want to dedicate a significant portion of your life to. I write this and still don’t know the answer to that. If money is your incentive, you won’t last long. It has to be about aligning your purpose with creating the change you want to see in the world. If you are passionate about headphones, it may make sense to build a headphone company. If you despise mosquitos, perhaps you should begin manufacturing DEET. But the point is you have to have something specific that you are passionate about. Society rewards specificity. If you don’t have that thing yet, maybe you aren’t ready. If your passion is aligned with the business you want to start, you will probably do really well. Founders that build products they themselves would use are more successful on average. In some sense, it is up to the founder to find purpose-market fit before specializing in that space, becoming an expert, and ultimately finding product-market fit. If this is something you are truly passionate about, it won’t feel like working and spending 5+ years on it won’t be a challenge, it will be an honor.

"“An introvert’s brain responds differently to stimuli than an extrovert’s brain. Rather than extracting energy from social situations, introverts create their own energy. ” In my youth, Winter was my favorite month, and I never pinned down why. I had a great neighborhood and summers were filled with outdoor activities, backyard football, and building strong connections with people that became my best friends. Despite summers being more “fun,” Winter and I always resonated on the same wavelength. The cold is associated with “Winter Depression,” causing social withdrawal and depression. Still, I loved Winter. After some years, I found that I actually enjoy Winter because of the separation from others. It’s first important to dissect the words “fun,” “enjoyment,” and “happiness.” Our culture has ingrained in us an association of these to self-actualization and the premise that human existence is merely an attempt to capture these fleeting emotions. In reality, happiness is a carrot on a stick, it’s fluffy, and a facade. Often cited reasons for enjoying isolation are: (1) enjoying the quiet, (2) ability to engage in activities that really interest me, (3) valuing privacy, (4) helping to stay in touch with inner feelings. Only #2 can be considered fun, but many would still choose these activities over conventionally energizing activities. Why is that? Ceteris paribus, humans are purpose-seeking. Through maturity, adults tend to focus increasingly on this. See my first essay, THE CEMETERY . I was first introduced to the concept of improvement when I was 12. At some point, I decided that it was really important I became good at soccer; it was something to work towards, and I soon became addicted to the progress. You could find me playing from morning to sunset every day. I didn’t need anyone to join me, my company was enough. This was my first taste of progress, which fueled the competitive rigor leading to achievements in years to come–all of which took sacrifice that inspired pride. No human’s path is the same. We are all here to fulfill our own destiny. The problem is that spending time with others is often dilutive to achieving self-actualization. Those who are focused seem to be more withdrawn, but this is simply because they have more important matters to tend to, even if in their own head. This is why words like “fun” don’t capture the energy that is found in solitude or the wavelength that I find in Winter. When we are alone, we tend towards our natural selves. Being around others can be constricting in that sense, it pulls from introverts’ internal energy. It can feel like we are being strangled from our creative energy. Society isn’t set up to support this type, which is why it took so long to discover I was an introvert. When I am alone, I discover a form of creativity that is not possible around others. An energy is created that can’t be replicated socially. Personally, this will be something I will try to explore more in the years to come. Others should as well."
