Introducing Fractional AI,https://travismay.medium.com/introducing-fractional-ai-3200c35db399?source=rss-519ecefb7852------2,"I am thrilled to announce the launch of Fractional AI , led by Chris Taylor and Eddie Siegel (two superstars who I worked with at LiveRamp). Fractional AI is an elite dev shop focused on enterprise applications of generative AI. We believe that many of the biggest benefits of generative AI will come from automating workflows at large companies; we expect trillions of dollars of value will be created in the economy over the next decade by increasing automation and giving talented employees more leverage. But the companies with the biggest automation opportunities often are not designed to hire the talent needed to accomplish this. Our goal is to bridge this gap — and ensure that elite engineering talent is deployed to the highest-impact automation opportunities. This post walks through our founding thesis of Fractional AI, and why we believe this is such a valuable opportunity. *** A decade from now, we believe large incumbents will be 2–10x more productive per capita — primarily by automating existing workflows. There are now thousands of AI startups in Silicon Valley, many of which are chasing after becoming the next AI product company. While some new products will emerge, we believe that the most revolutionary impact of generative AI for enterprises will be helping to automate existing workflows for incumbents. These incumbents are the companies with strong market positions and long-standing problems measured in billions of dollars that were unsolvable before the rise of AI. Even modest enhancements in productivity or automation can result in huge value creation when multiplied by their large scale. And unlike other technology shifts, AI is uniquely suited for automating workflows — everything from improving call center operations to medical billing to customer service has a realistic path to automation. And these companies are keenly aware of this — C-level executives and board members at every company of consequence are thinking hard about this AI-led wave of disruption as both an enormous opportunity and an existential threat. The challenges for incumbents to take advantage of generative AI are real. So why haven’t these companies adopted GenAI in a meaningful way? We could cite Gartner reports all day; 79% of corporate strategists see AI as critical to their success over the next 2 years, yet only 20% report using AI. Worse yet, only 10% of enterprises used AI in production in 2023. And this isn’t a simple case of large companies moving slowly — conversations with leaders at small, fast moving tech companies tell a similar story. Everybody has ideas for high impact AI projects, but very few projects have made it past the starting line. If you zoom in on the ways that these companies have actually adopted AI, it’s usually not the transformative, billion-dollar overhauls you see. They’re starting with low-hanging fruit — using ChatGPT internally, making simple OpenAI API calls, or maybe attempting a PoC of some internally-facing RAG applications. But the truly seismic opportunities, like embedding custom models deep into customer interactions or overhauling call centers, remain largely untapped. These are complicated: they are often risky projects with high uncertainty and cost, they don’t have natural owners or budgets and span multiple parts of organizations, and they require bespoke solutions that aren’t readily served by the market. But we believe that the biggest challenge is a talent bottleneck. The biggest bottleneck is talent. Few of the largest enterprises have focused on hiring the “best of the best” for engineering talent. Most of the time, this talent is expensive and difficult to hire at scale, and great engineers are motivated by engineering-centric cultures, high talent density, interesting technical challenges, and high compensation. While many tech startups focus on recruiting this kind of talent, the needs of a large enterprise simply don’t warrant specializing in this type of hiring. But this moment is different: to really take advantage of AI for automation, you need elite engineers. The best engineers will be on the forefront of AI best practices when they exist, and will be able to succeed in the face of uncertainty when they do not. For those uncertain projects where a clever approach is the difference between success and failure, great engineering is a crucial ingredient. So large enterprises are simultaneously the best positioned to reap the productivity benefits of AI, and poorly suited to hire the talent needed to accomplish this. Fractional AI Fractional AI exists to bridge this gap. We’re building a world-class engineering team that is focused on unlocking massive value using AI. We do what the big companies can’t by building an in-person team in San Francisco and fostering the culture that attracts and retains highly skilled engineers. We challenge them with meaningful work, invest in their growth, pay them well, and surround them with impressive people. We’re building the kind of startup culture that makes the best engineers actually want to come to work every day. Our mission is to inspire an elite team of engineers to solve the world’s most valuable problems using AI Our model This high caliber team works hand-in-glove with the world’s most consequential companies to solve their most valuable problems with the help of AI. Companies hire us for a blend of consulting and hands-on software creation, tailored to each client’s unique needs. This services-oriented business model has a number of advantages for our clients: It enables us to embrace the bespoke nature of these challenging AI problems; rather than building a product that solves 80% of a need for many companies, we can focus on getting all the way to 100% for a single client. It lets us see how real-world problems are solved with AI across many companies, which gives us the vantage point needed to be on the cutting edge of best practices. For risky projects with uncertain outcomes, we can share in the risk and share in the upside. It will align incentives and help our clients keep costs down for projects that don’t pan out, paying more only when massive value is unlocked. Another thing we love about this vantage point is how success feeds our ability to invest in our employees: Being on the cutting edge makes for a great learning opportunity. Employees can join with strong engineering skills but limited AI experience and leave as AI trailblazers. We have a unique opportunity to experience a best-of-all-worlds work environment: large, impactful, interesting projects with recognizable brands, but an exciting, fast-paced startup culture. By seeing valuable projects across many companies, we’re well positioned to spot patterns. When clients experience common pain points that can be alleviated by products that don’t exist yet, we can invest in creating them. Many of our best team members will have an entrepreneurial nature, and this will give us pathways to feed that in the form of side bets, spinoffs, and joint ventures with our clients. While these two elements of our model feed each other, they also represent separate and distinct commitments. Our dedication to our clients and our team are both first-class attributes of the company, and neither takes precedence over the other."
Company-Building during the AI Wave,https://travismay.medium.com/company-building-during-the-ai-wave-f43102a17032?source=rss-519ecefb7852------2,"For anyone starting a company in 2024, there are new questions to grapple with, such as “How is AI going to change this industry,” “are we in an AI bubble,” “are incumbents going to win with AI or are new startups going to win,” and “is AI for X a good startup idea even though dozens of other companies are going after the same goal?” This post walks through the principles I’ve used when considering AI opportunities to bet on. 1. Act like it’s 1995. I’ve generally been a skeptic of hyped industries (eg. crypto, web3, etc.). AI is the first hype wave that I’ve become a true believer in. Even as a true believer, I don’t believe that the most extreme outcomes are likely. Instead of AI putting humans out of work, my bet is more modest: I would bet on a 2–5x surge in American productivity over the next decade. While this is a much smaller outcome than many AI advocates believe is likely, this would be a massive change for the US economy and society — and an even bigger outcome than the .com boom. Based on this assumption, I look at the world like it’s 1995 for the .com boom — we are very early in a massive transformation in the economy, and while there is some froth and some ups and downs that will come in the coming years, fundamentally there is about to be an explosion in value for AI innovation. As a result, I believe that: This is a moment to be long on everything. It’s part of why I embarked on Shaper and think it makes sense to start lots of companies simultaneously. This is the best time ever to start a new company. There is a massive amount of innovation about to take place, and value to be captured by innovators. 2. Fundamentals matter, and companies need to find defensibility. Many companies are being started with the view of “X is possible, and if I do X, it will revolutionize an industry.” Even in cases where that may be true, it doesn’t necessarily result in a good startup idea; the fundamentals of “will this be a good business at steady state” still need to be true. In particular, in the race to execute on exciting opportunities with AI, it seems like many companies aren’t asking themselves whether their business is defensible; in the long-term, these companies will not thrive, even if they were the first to bring AI into X industry. Being a first-mover can be valuable if it’s a means to an end to create a defensible moat, but economic returns will ultimately accrue to the portion of the value chain that creates differentiated value and has few substitutes. As a corollary — the advantages that large incumbents in many industries have (clear moats, distribution networks, etc.) will continue to be advantages in a post-AI world, and large incumbents that are clever about utilizing AI will emerge stronger than ever. 3. Beware Silicon Valley dogma that is no longer applicable. While fundamentals matter that are based on first principles, there are many pieces of startup dogma that I think are not necessarily true in the AI era. For example, I think the “product” vs. “services” distinction is not especially relevant, and is not based on first principles. Margin certainly matters, and scalability certainly matters — which has historically been correlated with being a “product” business. But in the era of AI, there will be high-margin, highly-scalable “services” businesses as well. Similarly, optimizing for “recurring revenue” in SAAS is overly dogmatic. Having strong long-term value from customers with minimal customer acquisition costs is a relevant goal from first principles, but recurring revenue isn’t the only way to get there; Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon don’t have recurring revenue models today on their core businesses. I’d predict that many top companies innovate on pricing as well. 4. Opportunity abounds in the complements The AI wave won’t only benefit “AI companies;” it will also benefit complementary technologies and businesses. For example, the area I’m most focused on is data. While data itself doesn’t change with AI, I predict the value of certain data sets to skyrocket based on the AI wave, because it is so valuable to AI companies. I’d predict that many of the most valuable businesses created by the AI wave won’t be directly related to AI, but rather are complementary to AI. 5. Figuring out product market fit will be hard. One of Datavant’s board members always asked the same valuable question in 100% of board meetings: “What percentage of your customers are getting fundamental value from you, and what percentage use you in their ‘innovation showcase’?” This was always an extremely useful question. The reality is, large entreprises spend money on technology that creates value for them, but they also spend money on “innovation projects” that are ultimately proofs of concepts or vanity projects. True product-market fit is based on creating fundamental value for customers. During a major boom, lots of money is spent on “innovation showcase” projects — and it’s possible to get a large amount of revenue without having true product-market fit. Differentiating “revenue growth” from “product-market fit” will be complex for entrepreneurs, but large economic outcomes will only come from companies that get true product-market fit. 6. Blitzscaling will make a comeback in some areas. In the 2010s, blitzscaling was popular as a strategy, and often made sense as a strategy: because interest rates were low, spending capital today for growth tomorrow made sense. There were many companies that took this too far, and threw money away wastefully. By 2022, this became frowned upon, and companies had a wave of belt-tightening as interest rates went up. Even with higher interest rates, the strategy of blitzscaling still fundamentally makes sense in many AI businesses: in a moment of rapid technical change and large prizes for moving rapidly, going into “land grab” mode makes sense as a strategy. Companies will need to ask themselves how quickly an industry will change, how much first-mover advantage matters, and what the prize is at the end (eg. is there defensibility at steady-state). As a result, there will be more companies in 2024 that pursue a blitzscaling strategy, and losing money in the near-term can be a viable strategy. (Hopefully, this doesn’t become synonymous with “wasteful spending” again— but there will be companies that take this too far) 7. Talent will be the bottleneck As industries change quickly with AI, many companies will win by being nimble and quickest to capitalize on market changes. The biggest lever in corporate nimbleness/velocity is talent, and great talent will become even more valuable. While “AI talent” is at a premium today, much of the value will actually come from generalist talent. Strong generalist engineers who can figure out how to incorporate AI into technical workflows will become increasingly valuable. Strong generalist managers who can figure out how to navigate a rapidly-changing industry will become increasingly valuable. Companies that have access to the best generalist talent will disproportionately move faster, and disproportionately win. While this has always been true, I believe that the AI wave will amplify this effect."
A Playbook for Building a B2B Network Business,https://travismay.medium.com/a-playbook-for-building-a-b2b-network-business-90964781a516?source=rss-519ecefb7852------2,"For both LiveRamp and Datavant, a key factor in our success was internally viewing the businesses as a “network” from day 1, and methodically following a network playbook. From VISA to telecom companies to cable companies, many of the largest companies ever built are networks. These businesses have literal “network effects,” because their value to customers increases as their network expands. VISA is incredibly convenient for consumers because it is widely adopted by merchants, and it is critical for merchants because so many consumers have a VISA card. Network density becomes the killer feature for network businesses. The playbook for building a network business is subtly different from businesses with other strategies. “Escape velocity” and “minimum viable network” become core concepts in company building, as getting to critical mass as quickly as possible becomes existential. Most B2B companies are not network businesses, so many of the playbooks and pattern matching by investors and experienced executives don’t perfectly apply to network businesses. Below are some of the approaches I’ve found helpful in building out network businesses. Tactic 1: Have Clear Network KPIs — nodes & edges A simple step of building a network business is to rally the company around network metrics. Without explicit network KPIs, revenue and other metrics will domniate as the focus of a company, which are generally imperfectly correlated with network expansion. A lack of metrics also leads to lots of internal arguments over whether strategy A or B is right for the network, without a clear optimization function for resolving debates. At Datavant, in the early days, we had two metrics that we tracked relentlessly (as closely as we tracked revenue): nodes of the network (what we called “installed sites”) , and edges in the network (what we called “links”): A node was a company that was using Datavant technology; once they used us once, it was very easy for others in the network to do business with that company in the future. Edges were unique relationships between different parties in the network; if company A sourced data from company B and company C, that would be 2 edges. This was a rough metric of network throughput. Establishing these metrics and prioritizing them relentlessly made many other aspects of our strategy clear, as you’ll see below. Tactic 2: Look for subnetworks to get density Generally, what we think of as a “network” actually consists of lots of subnetworks, each of which have their own internal network effects and where it is easier to get to critical mass network density. For example, Facebook was built by being a social network at Harvard, then a social network at Ivy League schools, then a social network at all colleges, then a social network for everyone. This meant that at the early colleges, Facebook had critical mass density, well before it had critical mass everywhere. Had they tried to launch everywhere initially, even if they had the same initial number of users, they would not have had critical mass density anywhere — and would have failed to get traction. For Datavant, we found that the ecosystem around commercial claims data was a subtly different ecosystem than the ecosystem around oncology data, which was subtly different than the ecosystem around public sector, and subtly different than clinical trials; all of these networks needed to be connected in the long-term, but we could get to “critical mass density” more quickly by focusing on specific areas. So we methodically focused on different submarkets where critical mass density was feasible. Tactic 3: Go narrow on features. Common advice is to go after a product with a large total addressable market; I think that this is perhaps the worst advice that VCs frequently give to entrepreneurs. In reality, while it is good to build sequentially into a larger and larger TAM, you want to go after the smallest viable TAM to get there: narrow products are much easier to crack a network effect. You want to go narrow on two dimensions: Size of network. In the Facebook example, it’s easier to build “the social network for Harvard students” than the “social network for everybody” precisely because it’s a smaller market. Size of feature set. You ideally want to have the minimum viable number of features in the early days. In a true network business, each individual feature has its own chicken-and-egg network effect (eg. “phone calls” and “texting” both require critical mass adoption, even though they’re on the same network), so you want to avoid fighting for critical mass adoption on multiple fronts simultaneously. Additionally, because ubiquity is so important, you’ll want large incumbents to rely on you as a channel partner (more on that below), and so reducing your feature set decreases your level of competitive threat — letting you more quickly get network scale. Tactic 4: Cultivate network-referred sales In Datavant’s early days, one of the most amazing features of the business was that ~90% of new business was customer-referred — meaning our best marketing channel (by far) was existing customers. This is true in a lot of network businesses: your power customers get value from your network expanding, and so — if you align closely with them — they refer lots of additional customers your way. To make this work, obviously it was important that our product added enough value for us to be referred frequently, but it was also critical for us to make the sales reps at the partner want to bring us into conversations . This involved us obsessing with being perceived as quick & easy to work with, willingness to not take too much of the pie, and having sales reps who could deftly handle three-way conversations. Tactic 5: Look for supernodes When most companies think about their wishlist of perfect customers, they think about who can drive the most revenue potential. In a network business, the perfect customer instead maximizes the network throughput (which is imperfectly correlated with revenue). For Datavant, a counter-intuitive part of our initial strategy was focusing our sales on the ecosystem of analytics companies servicing pharma, instead of servicing pharma companies directly. Almost every VC we spoke with had the view “all the money is in pharma; you should focus on them;” all of our competitors went in this direction. Instead, our view was that analytics companies are power users of data and drive more network activity than pharma, and have faster sales cycles — so it’s the faster path to network ubiquity. We especially doubled down on the handful of customers that became “supernodes;” at our peak, our 5 biggest customers were driving ~25% of our network activity. Even if they weren’t giant from a revenue perspective, this drove our network to take off. Tactic 6: Become channel agnostic If the primary goal is to get as much network throughput as quickly as possible, a useful accelerant is channel partnerships. The main downside of channel partnerships (assuming you can successfully set them up — they are tricky to operationalize) is that you lose the relationship with the end customer, and ultimately capture less value per customer. In a network business, these are generally very reasonable tradeoffs for accelerating your footprint more quickly. At LiveRamp, when we were $30 mm ARR, ~80% of our revenue came from 5 channel partners; we only started going direct when we were much larger. While this was an unusual path, channel relationships shaved several years off of our path to becoming perceived as the universal standard in the industry and getting to escape velocity. Tactic 7: Short-term success = Long-term success In every business, the CEO has a complex job of balancing short-term goals (hit the number this quarter) with long-term goals (eg. build the product successfully). In a network business, I think short-term goals and long-term goals are extremely correlated: your long-term success is determined more than anything else by hitting network escape velocity. Being successful in the short-term is the most important determinant of long-term success because it unlocks more network density, which in turn makes your product more compelling. Short-term momentum also creates a sense of inevitability in the market and swagger within your team, which becomes self-fulfilling. So I generally am “short-termist” in goals, looking for accelerants for how we maximize our success this quarter/month/week — not because I don’t care about the long-term, but precisely because I believe short-term success is the biggest driver of long-term success, and escape velocity is everything. Tactic 8: Make it a no-brainer to work with you. As you establish network ubiquity, customers are making bets on whether they want to be in your network — and you want the answer to be an obvious yes. This means you need to be relentless about being low-friction to work with, and never lose deals on price or extraneous contract terms. Remember, nodes are valuable — even if they don’t pay you anything. That doesn’t mean you should make your product free by default (that rarely works as a strategy to increase adoption), but it does mean you should have a mechanism to discount aggressively when needed, and make the standard on the sales team to never lose a deal to competition on price. Similarly, you want to be seen as easy to work with — quick to turnaround contracts, great support, and a general culture of excellence + velocity . Make the choice to partner with you as much of a no-brainer as possible. Tactic 9: Look for step functions on network expansion The vast majority of growth for network businesses should come from a relentless grind for more and more nodes and edges one at a time. Beyond pushing this grind forward, part of the CEO’s job is also to find the step functions. Some step functions are more complex partnerships — setting up the right channel partnerships, or finding the incumbents who can help “king-make” your network. In the early days of VISA, they spent several years obsessing over their relationships with banks as their most critical partners. Network businesses also lend themselves to more early-stage M&A than other business models. The most straightforward M&A hypotheses are usually finding complimentary subnetworks, and are along the lines of “we are the leading railroad of the east; you are the leading railroad of the west; we can combine and become the leading railroad in the country.” When that’s actually true and expands the network dramatically, 1+1 can equal 5 in combining the networks. Tactic 10: Make ubiquity part of the brand The killer feature of most network businesses is the fact that they are ubiquitous; phones are great because everyone has a phone, and VISA cards are great because they’re accepted everywhere. All the other features are secondary. As you build your company brand, it’s helpful to make ubiquity an explicit part of the brand. Just like VISA is “everywhere you want to be,” you want to be perceived as ubiquitous. This can be done with how you describe your company, the sense of momentum that you create for your company, the conferences you host, the advisors you engage, etc. — but you want to ensure that there is a sense of inevitability around you. Before you have established a massive network, your customers are making decisions to bet on you; if they believe that you will be ubiquitous, that’s an easier bet to make. So building the sense of inevitability becomes self-fulfilling. Tactic 11: Look for ways to eliminate network effects in the early days Once you’ve established a minimum viable network, network effects are an amazing feature of a business model by creating a strong moat and driving customer-referred sales. Until you reach that point, network effects can work against you. Why would anybody join a network that doesn’t have critical mass? One hack around this is to look for “single player mode” approaches . In this analogy, multi-player video games are games that have network effects; they require enough other players to want to play simultaneously. An effective way for games to get to that point is to have a great “single-player mode” — where people play against the computer directly, so the product is valuable whether or not there’s a network already playing. In other words, if it’s possible to eliminate the network effects to start, that can be an effective way to bypass the chicken-and-egg problem until you have a critical mass of customers. At Datavant, the use cases we serviced initially were around connecting internal data sets (which did not require a network), before we had the critical mass to also connect external data sets . *** A visualization of how network effects scale, thanks to Wikipedia. These tactics all exist as a means to reach network escape velocity. For a network business, network density and throughput is everything, and escape velocity is the moment where the density goes from holding you back until the network effect begins to work in your favor."
Building the Right Operating Cadence,https://travismay.medium.com/building-the-right-operating-cadence-6c608fd142e1?source=rss-519ecefb7852------2,"This article is a playbook for CEOs on what rituals, meetings, and processes to introduce at each stage of a high-growth tech company’s journey. *** A common theme of my posts is that operating velocity is one of the most important determinants of success for a business. Operating velocity helps you create an exceptional culture and phenomenal team, both of which are critical ingredients to moving even faster. There is one other ingredient that makes or breaks the velocity of a company: its operating cadence. By the time you cross 10 employees, as CEO, you start to ritualize key team events. Events like the “Weekly All-Hands” become a standard way that communication occurs and culture is built. As you get bigger, these events are the “operating cadence” of a company — they are the rhythm of an organization that shape how decisions get made and how information is shared as companies scale. Different companies have different operating cadences: some companies are meeting-heavy, and some underemphasize communication; some companies develop process too early, and others too late. As companies cross a few hundred employees, almost all communication and decision-making needs to work its way into the operating cadence. Great CEOs build their operating cadences with intentionality, thinking about what communications are critical to whom and the best forums for the communication to take place. A few principles in process design are important here: Unless you are a nuclear power plant, 95% of your operating cadence should be “positive process” (process that accelerates the team by reducing steps required for coordination) over “negative process” (process that is designed as a checkpoint to prevent mistakes) Bias towards centralized process when there’s complex cross-team coordination, and against centralized process otherwise. Design your organization to minimize these scenarios. Require the minimum viable number of people in meetings to make processes effective (and encourage people to not come if the process isn’t helpful) To avoid meeting creep, eliminate processes with meetings unless the benefit is very crisp Give people access to the information they need to run their parts of the business — use emails, team meetings, etc. to curate and distribute information transparently This post walks through the key rituals that were part of the Datavant & LiveRamp operating cadence at scale (>500 employees), and then outlines what stage we added each ritual. While each subteam had its own rituals, these were the ones that made it onto my radar as key events. *** Team-Wide Communication: Weekly Team Meetings. Starting when the companies were 5 employees, we set up a weekly 30-minute meeting to touch base on “what’s going on in the company” — and scaled this as we grew. We scheduled these for Monday mornings, and we had ~2 minute updates from each major function leader, as well as 1–2 “ spotlight topics” (selected by me or my Chief of Staff to curate what was important) per week. Win Celebrations. Rituals to celebrate company wins are extremely helpful — they focus the organization on key outcomes, and also create a morale boost with momentum. Up to 100 people, we had “Gong Time,” where every time a key deal was closed or major win happened, someone would ring a gong…and every few days we’d gather round the gong for people to talk about their wins. We also encouraged “Deal Won” emails — where the sales rep would email the whole team would outline a deal that just closed, and context on the customer’s use case. From there, the rest of the team would respond with congratulations. The last day of the quarter was especially fun! Quarterly Company, Team, and Individual OKRs. On the first day of the quarter, I would send the full company objectives & key results for the quarter; we would then have a “quarterly kickoff” meeting within the first week where we’d review the outcomes from the last quarter and discuss the goals for the next quarter. I generally locked on these with the management team a week ahead of time, and then team leaders would send out the teams’ goals (for teams where OKRs were the right format). And we would publicly set individual OKRs as well within the first week — so everyone could see each others’ goals and focus areas. Quarterly All-Stakeholder Emails. On the first day of each quarter, I sent a ~3 page recap of the last quarter to all of the company’s shareholders, as well as the team and all of our advisors. A well-written recap helps to make it clear how individual accomplishments connect to the big picture, and reiterate the big picture. Sharing financials. I shared all of our board decks with the team (including full financials except specific compensation information), and our monthly financial flash reports, along with some curation/explanation by the finance team. Weekly Digest. Once we crossed ~200 people, we began sending “weekly digests” — with key announcements and big wins. These were typically owned by a Chief of Staff with some input by me, ensuring that the most important themes are consistently highlighted. Lunch & Learns. Starting around 20 employees, we had weekly “lunch & learns” — optional meetings where a team member would walk through some topic relevant to the business. From guest presentations by clients to an overview of our cap table to a deep dive on policy changes impacting our business, these were usually interesting — and provided an outlet for optional, structured content. Bi-annual offsite. If part/all of the team is remote, it’s critical to get people together on some frequency. Up to 500 people, we made this a camping trip. Sunday Thoughts . Every Sunday, I would email the team an email on whatever was top-of-mind for me (often about our strategy, or a customer use case I was excited about, or something I was concerned about, etc.) Retrospectives. Starting at just a few employees, we had a robust culture of retrospectives. Whenever a major event happened (especially one where we made mistakes), the team involved would write a retrospective of what we learned and publish it to the whole company. This helped normalize mistakes happening and learning from them without having a culture of blame. Leadership Team Coordination: Weekly Management Meetings. Once you cross 30 employees, you need some form of regular cadence of meetings with a management team. I hosted these meetings weekly for 45–60 minutes and ran the agenda as a “communication/alignment meeting” rather than a “decision meeting” — decisions were made by the right subgroups offline. Weekly Outcomes Tracker. One of the best micro-hacks I’ve found for communication is the weekly status tracker. Each week, by Sunday evening, every member of the management team would fill out a shared Google Sheet with three columns next to each executive’s name: “Top 3 priorities for next week”, “Up to 3 positive outcomes from last week”, “Up to 3 negative outcomes from last week.” Everyone was expected to read this document ahead of our management meeting and ask questions of each other. Quarterly Leadership Offsites. Starting around 30 employees, we hosted a one-day offsite once a quarter for the management team (often in a conference room down the hall, but sometimes traveling if a critical mass of the team is remote). The goal was debate/discussion/alignment (NOT decision-making). We would pick 3–6 topics for the day (example: “is it time to do an international launch”), and give each topic an owner who would prepare a 1–3 page pre-read. Quarterly Board Meetings. As soon as we had external capital, we began hosting quarterly 3-hour quarterly board meetings (as long as 2-days for public companies, but I think 3-hours is sufficient). In between board meetings, we hosted mid-quarter sales/financial updates (30–60 minutes). The most productive board meetings I’ve hosted had elaborate pre-read packages, where each executive gave a 1–2 page update on their function, and ~30 minutes was spent on Q&A with the board, followed by 2.5 hours of “spotlight” topics. Weekly 1:1’s. These are nobody’s favorite meetings…but I think they’re essential parts of a healthy operating cadence at any size. I let my direct reports set the agenda, and also have a “below the line” portion of the agenda with updates I should be aware of. Most skip-level 1:1’s were ad hoc. Monthly Business Reviews. Once we crossed 200 employees, I began spending a day each month in “business reviews” to systematically get updates and provide feedback on key initiatives across the business. Each month, I would ask 10–20 leaders of key initiatives to do monthly, 30-minute update sessions on their initiative. To make these sessions valuable, each meeting was capped with only 2–8 attendees, and there was a 1–2 page pre-read plus 1–2 “discussion topics” for the meeting. Customers & Sales: Deal Desk. As companies cross 100 employees, it can be frustrating for a sales person to get a deal done — depending on the deal, they may need legal signoff, finance sign-off, privacy sign-off, product sign-off, sales leadership signoff on pricing, etc. To make this fast (but ensure there’s adequate review by key stakeholders), we had a simple template that the sales rep would fill out and send to a “deal desk” email alias. Most deals would be approved on the same-day, but we had a standing “deal desk” meeting as a venue for escalation. Customer Aliases. For every customer, we created an email alias (eg. client123@datavant.com) that included all the people involved in supporting the account, as well as anyone in the company that wanted to track the account. Then, whenever we communicated with the client, we CC’d the alias, so lots of people internally could track what’s happening. This was great for quick information-sharing across delivery and sales teams, and also a helpful way for leadership to know the pulse of key accounts. At-Risk Reviews. Once you cross $20mm of ARR, it’s helpful to have a regularly-scheduled discussion of what accounts have churn risk associated with them. If something churns that is not on the list, that means you have an information problem. We held these monthly. Quarterly Sales Kick-off. The beginning of the quarter is a key moment for sales — and we used these kickoffs to discuss our path to hit the number, updates in the market, and updates in the product. Quarterly Partnership Reviews. Each quarter, we would try to have a check-in meeting with executive sponsors at almost all of our customers — even if there wasn’t an imminent upsell or churn event. Account Planning Brainstorms. Once there were more than 10 people on the sales team, it was helpful for the sales team to do deep dives with each other to know the details of key accounts. Key executives would join these and publicly brainstorm how we can grow our most important partners. Red Alerts. Whenever something bad was happening for an account (disappointed client, churn, etc.), we expected the account owner to email the “red alerts” alias. This went to a bunch of key leaders in the org, so there could be widespread visibility on the issue (and escalation or creating a war room if needed). Product & Engineering: Quarterly Roadmapping. The roadmapping process is the single most important source of decision-making in most tech companies; micro- and macro-decisions are locked on through this process. I have never seen a company that loves it’s roadmapping process; it’s either too granular or not detailed enough. If there are more than 30 engineers, I am a fan of a process that allows for prioritizing 1–4 “big bets” at an executive level, allocation of resources across pods at an executive level, and then decision-making on the long-tail of projects at the pod level. A great product leader is critical to be able to navigate the big picture discussion with the micro-allocations that are being made. Annual product vision. Every year, I think it’s important to refresh the 3–5 year product vision — and either reconfirm what you’re building towards, or update the vision. I usually make this a late December project with the Head of Product and then they present it to the company as part of the yearly kick-off. Quarterly hackathons. There are always lots of competing priorities that make it feel like you should cancel this quarter’s hackathon. You shouldn’t. Many of the best ideas in a company are born in hackathons, and they’re a critical outlet for the innovation of the team. These are even more important as the team grows beyond 100 people. Legal, Security, and Privacy: Deal desk. Outlined above…the deal desk was the key forum for ensuring there was legal/privacy visibility on all deals and an outlet to review, without unnecessarily delaying deals. Roadmapping. Roadmapping isn’t just for product! It’s helpful to have a moment where there can be meaningful debate about “invest in SOC-2 or HiTrust” or “tradeoffs between going deep on GDPR or CCPA expertise.” I encourage leaders of functions that touch lots of different constituencies to host quarterly roadmapping sessions to make some of these debates clear. HR: Hotspot Reviews. Once you cross 100 employees, there are always several “fires” going on within the organization. I use a monthly “hotspots” meeting to track these fires systematically. Ahead of these, the People team would put together a list of hotspots/fires in the organization (eg. ABC team is low-morale right now; X key performer is probably about to resign because of tension with person Y; etc.), and rank their urgency on a scale of 1–5. At scale, there are usually dozens of fires, and it’s helpful to flip through the list; we would then use the meeting to talk through 1–5 of the issues that are most important and most solvable. Offer Approval Process. Starting at ~5 employees, I think it’s important to systematically think about how offers are made and approved: ensuring that you’re defaulting to no, hiring for strengths rather than lack of weaknesses, and have a high bar across the team. More on this process here . 9-Box Reviews. Firing people is one of the hardest things in business, and as a result, every company biases too much towards keeping low-performers. One approach to correcting this bias is a formalized 9-box review , where managers need to categorize their team as High/Medium/Low performance, and High/Medium/Low potential. With good discipline around forcing distributions, you then have visibility and a framework to encourage managers to part ways with low performers. Leveling & Compensation Reviews. As you cross 50 people, having “levels” for compensation becomes a helpful guide for the appropriate/default salary and equity of a new hire. I believe managers should be empowered to give raises ad hoc, but there should also be an annual process of confirming cross-team fairness. Pulse Survey. Once you cross 200 people, it becomes important to have a quantitative view of the mood of the company, broken down by team. We used quarterly, short (<10 question, custom designed as questions we cared about) surveys. Annual Performance Reviews. While micro-feedback should be given every day/week/month, meaningful, curated feedback about how employees can grow is important to do at least once per year. New hire onboarding. Starting around 20 employees, we were extremely focused on having a great new hire onboarding program — and making sure people walk out of their first week able to clearly articulate the vision, strategy, priorities, and culture — and know how to get things done internally. I met with every new hire cohort at the end of orientation to reinforce our culture and promote accessibility of leadership. Financial: Annual Budgeting Cycle. Once you have multiple employees, you need some form of budget, and once your revenue or burn exceeds $5 mm., it makes sense to start formalizing a budget process. At <$20 mm of revenue, this should be very lightweight. Monthly & Quarterly Financial Results. Having quick, clear visibility on the financial metrics becomes critical as you cross around $10 mm. ARR and can no longer keep all the numbers in your head. I like to share these results with the whole organization. Quarterly Forecasting. Once you cross $50 mm. in revenue (and especially if you are a public company), ongoing forecasts become critical. These are important to keep lightweight, but are helpful as leading financial indicators. *** When to introduce process As you can see above, there are dozens of processes that exist to be able to systematically have good communications and decision-making at scale. In an early stage, a lot of this is overkill. There is an art to introducing a process when it’s constructive, but not too early and not too late. This is my rough strawman for some of the processes above. And of course…there is also an art to killing processes that aren’t adding value (and making sure the processes are meaningfully time consuming, don’t have too large of meetings, etc.). Every company should look different. In the end, a good operating cadence is designed to help a company with a good culture and good talent to be high velocity."
Introducing Arbital Health — A Neutral Umpire for Outcome-Based Contracts,https://travismay.medium.com/introducing-arbital-health-a-neutral-umpire-for-outcome-based-contracts-ee69655426c5?source=rss-519ecefb7852------2,"Introducing Arbital Health — A Neutral Umpire for Outcome-Based Contracts I’m thrilled to announce Arbital Health , one of the first companies incubated at Shaper Capital , partnering with Brian Overstreet as CEO. In the coming weeks, we will be sharing more about the incredible team coming together and some of our early moves to make this vision a reality. Below is an overview of our vision. We aim to solve one of the most fundamental problems in healthcare — and in turn help unlock a health system with better outcomes, better value, and better experiences for patients. **** The biggest problem in healthcare is misaligned incentives. The healthcare system suffers from low quality, poor experience, high cost, and poor outcomes. The fundamental reason for this is a market failure due to misaligned incentives. Organizations that deliver care and therapy manufacturers have vastly different incentives than organizations that pay for care, who in turn have vastly different incentives than patients. The thousands of middlemen throughout the system only add to the problem. Most other issues in healthcare are downstream of this fundamental problem. To align incentives, we should move away from fee-for-service pricing towards paying for value. Most healthcare today is provided in a fee-for-service model — the more services delivered, the more you pay. Instead, healthcare should be paid for based on the outcomes delivered. The cost for a drug like Ozempic should be based on weight loss or reduction of diabetes and cardiovascular events, not another high fixed prescription fee. Providers that invest in their patients to prevent chronic disease should be rewarded, not stymied by a system that incentivizes more treatment and quick fixes. A value-based care system can align all parties toward an outcomes-based set of incentives. But there is a challenge: how do you measure value in care? “Value” is subjective. Even for objective outcomes, the counterparties in a value-based transaction struggle today to reconcile contracts. Data is fragmented, trust is low, analytics are sparse, and incentives remain misaligned. The process of reconciling an outcome-based contract can take several quarters, and can turn into a major renegotiation when the two sides disagree on metrics. We are launching Arbital Health to be a neutral umpire of outcome-based contracts. We will focus on earning the industry’s trust as a neutral and accurate third party. We will make it easy to design, measure, and adjudicate outcome-based contracts. In 10 years, we aspire to be the trusted umpire adjudicating every outcome-based contract in healthcare, whether contracts are between life sciences companies and payers, payers and providers, or employers and digital health companies. By creating Arbital Health, we believe that we will resolve one of the biggest roadblocks to the wide adoption of value-based care. We will make it simple to adjudicate contracts and unlock the trillion-dollar shift to value-based care in America. In doing so, we will help to solve healthcare’s biggest problem. *** Does this sound exciting? Join our team at careers@arbitalhealth.com ."
12 Principles on Building & Scaling Company Culture,https://travismay.medium.com/12-principles-on-building-scaling-company-culture-5e0d461c4275?source=rss-519ecefb7852------2,"Building LiveRamp and Datavant, the single thing I’m most proud of is the culture at the companies. Veterans of both businesses describe it as the most special moments of their career, the industry has viewed us as great to work with (or alternatively, viewed us as a cult), both companies thrived on Glassdoor and other metrics, and I was personally known for being culture-obsessed (or alternatively, a cult leader). This was not charity: by building a strong culture, I believe we were able to execute better and faster than others, and this capacity to predictably out-execute the market became a core part of our strategy. This is a playbook for how I think about building and scaling culture from the ground up. Principle 1: Be intentional in designing culture for a purpose. I’ve focused on designing cultures to optimize for company velocity . Principle 2: There are low-hanging ways to add velocity to every organization. Principle 3: Great culture has a defensible network effect. Principle 4: ~70% of culture is people. Obsess over recruiting, growing great people, and firing low performers. Principle 5: Keep control of hiring as long as possible. Principle 6: Mediocrity is the default as you scale. Fight to retain exceptionalism. Principle 7: Sweat the small things to add “antibodies.” Principle 8: Write down what makes culture distinctive. Evangelize these points and fight to keep them alive as long as it makes sense for your strategy. Principle 9: Stay lean as much as possible. Principle 10: Devote energy to reprogramming external hires. Principle 11: Distinctive culture unlocks distinctive strategy. Principle 12: Evolve intentionally. *** Principle 1: Be intentional in designing culture for a purpose. I’ve focused on designing cultures to optimize for company velocity . For most companies, culture is seen as a set of talking points that make the team feel good, but is not especially actionable (i.e. “we believe in teamwork, integrity, and winning!”) For some companies, building a distinctive culture is seen as a way to attract and retain good employees — but is not directly aligned to company strategy (i.e. tech companies offering lots of snacks and ping-pong tables). For the best companies, culture is treated as a purposeful part of the company’s strategy to differentiate on some axis . While there are many areas where a company can decide to differentiate, for most technology companies, I believe that speed of effective execution is the single biggest cultural determinant of success. For many of the best companies, the biggest commonality is that they simply move at a different pace than any others: being able to quickly iterate on ideas, capitalize on opportunities, close the next partnership, and ship the next product compounds exponentially, and can set companies apart. As a result — we focused on velocity as the key objective in developing culture at LiveRamp and Datavant. Principle 2: There are low-hanging ways to add velocity to every organization. I believe that a substantial amount of slack exists in every company; almost no organizations operate near the efficient frontier where speed needs to come with a tradeoff against quality, budget, or other constraints. So a key role of leaders is to set the pace and attempt to eliminate that slack. ( Amp It Up and Hustle as a Strategy are both great reads with the same overarching philosophy.) Here are a few approaches I’ve used to amplify speed: 1. Have high expectations on speed. In general, leaders should make it clear that they expect things to move quickly and set the pace in the organization. Turnaround time is often a cultural norm that can be tweaked. For example, at Datavant & LiveRamp, we had a norm of replying to all emails within 24-hours at the latest; just that expectation alone meant that small things wouldn’t be bottlenecked for a few days while it sat in somebody’s inbox, but didn’t add more work. Similarly, we tried to turn contracts around quickly, escalate decisions that weren’t quickly settled, make same-day decisions about candidates, and generally run at a different pace than “normal.” 2. Clarity of strategy. Extreme clarity of strategy makes it easy for people across the organization to weigh tradeoffs and make decisions. If you survey five people, and all five of them agree on “what are the most important priorities this month/quarter/year” — that makes decision-making much easier across the company; most companies fail this test, which causes micro-decisions to escalate. CEOs can drive clarity of strategy by committing to a definitive view of the future (and your company’s place in it), communicating this view clearly, and being willing to say “we are not going in X direction;” often CEOs try too hard to protect optionality and as a result lose this strategic clarity — slowing the company down. 3. Great internal communications & transparency of information . In addition to sharing strategy, sharing all sorts of information as context helps individuals across the company make better decisions. I put a lot of investment in internal communications: making sure people know the information they need to make good decisions. Part of this was extreme transparency (sharing full financials, board decks, bad news, making calendars public, etc.), part of this was designing cadences for visibility (company-wide public status updates and OKRs, “red event” escalation, customer email aliases, etc.), and part of this was focus on curating information for the team (thoughtful team meeting topics, thoughtful team emails, etc.). Being the communicator-in-chief is probably the single most important part of a CEOs job — and is critical to unlocking speed. 4. Clarity of decision rights . A lot of decisions get bottlenecked on who the decision-maker is ; without clarity, there is a push for consensus-driven decision-making. A key role of the CEO is to make it clear who owns what and how decisions should get made. For example, I often made it clear that the Product team was the tie-breaker in lots of decisions; I made it clear that I was not the decision-maker even when I had an opinion; I would clearly make someone “quarterback” on a specific initiative; etc. 5. Good org design. Until ~100 employees, org design doesn’t matter that much; the key is to just have your best leaders run key parts of the business. Once you cross 100 employees, org design matters as a flow of information and decision-making — and it becomes key to constantly adapt the org structure to make decisions quickly. 6. Caliber of people. I’ll discuss this in more detail below, but having extremely high-caliber people is critical for velocity. People who are high throughput move faster, but more importantly — the ability to trust that others will make high-quality decisions and have high-quality follow-through allows much more organizational throughput. 7. Empowerment. Much of the above (high-caliber people, clear strategy, good communications, etc.) are necessary ingredients to really be able to empower people — but if you accomplish all of those, you can then make it clear that people are empowered (and expected) to make decisions themselves and run quickly. Principle 3: Great culture has a defensible network effect. Like many of the most important aspects of strategy, company culture has strong network effects.​​ A strong culture directly drives great results — it means your company is wired to execute better than others on some dimension. For example, if you are faster than other companies…that speed compounds quarter after quarter in your results. Superstars are attracted to environments with strong cultures. For example, Datavant’s focus on velocity and the empowerment that came with that has made it an attractive place for ambitious people who want to maximize personal growth, which in turn has helped us get exceptional talent. Superstars are also attracted to great results. Hypergrowth, compelling corporate milestones, and the swagger of winning attracts many people to the team. Superstars directly help the results of the company Superstars also help shape the culture. For example, autonomy of decision-making is much easier to take hold as a cultural practice in an environment of superstars (where distributed decision-making is typically good) than in an environment of mediocre performance Winning reinforces the culture, and makes the cultural practices stick over time Like any virtuous cycle, this means that a great company can sustainably outperform others as long as the flywheel continues spinning; this means that a company with a superior culture can sustainably outperform a company with more capital or other resources. If any of the pillars are missing, this can quickly turn into a vicious cycle. Many companies compromise on the caliber of their team at some point or have a bad year or two at some point — which creates a spiral towards mediocrity if not carefully managed. Principle 4: ~70% of culture is people. Obsess over recruiting, growing great people, and firing low performers. When people have asked me about the culture of various organizations I’ve led, I’ve always started by describing how we think about talent. The reality is: if you accept having mediocre people, it’s hard to have a great culture. This isn’t just about having a top-tier of exceptional performers internally, or even a strong median employee; it’s about making sure there’s great talent across the organization . Many cultural practices (good or bad) are based on the talent level of the organization. For example, in an environment where team members are consistently high-performing, micromanagement is a counterproductive strategy by managers; in an environment where performance is mixed, micromanagement becomes more rational. So in environments where you can trust that those around you are high performing, practices evolve that are much more productive. To ensure a high level of talent across the board, the CEO needs to: Obsess over attracting great talent (I’ve always assumed I should spend ~20% of my time recruiting at any given moment, across stages) Build a recruiting machine to default to no and only hire superstars. Grow great people. The highest-performers are usually quick learners, and so can double their productivity year-over-year if consistently placed in stretch roles. Building the muscle for this is key. Obsess over retaining great people. It’s almost always worth the fight to keep the best people. Build the processes to fire low performers. For any manager who is human, firing someone is the hardest decision they make in business; they want to give low performers the benefit of the doubt and find a way to make it work, both for empathetic reasons and due to fears of what will happen without someone in a seat. But the reality is this instinct is counterproductive and sets a low bar for performance. This means that the CEO needs to help create the process to create a high performance bar to stay at the company. Principle 5: Keep control of hiring as long as possible. As a corollary to Principle 4…while I am generally an extreme delegator, hiring is the one area of the company where I believe I should bias towards micromanagement. It’s simply too easy for a few compromise hires in one function to break the whole culture of the organization. Principle 6: Mediocrity is the default as you scale. Fight to retain exceptionalism. By definition, most companies are average/mediocre, and many forces will conspire to try to make an exceptional company revert to mediocrity. Part of your job is to fight this descent to mediocrity as a company grows by continuing to set high standards, by being uncompromising to short-term tradeoffs against culture, by communicating what makes the company distinctive, and by staying relentless on talent. The network effects of great culture will help you maintain exceptionalism if you keep it as a priority, but the moment you deprioritize culture, reversion to the mean takes over. Principle 7: Sweat the small things to add “antibodies.” One way to scale an exceptional culture is to develop internal “antibodies” to counter-cultural behaviors. When there is a critical mass of “true believers” on core cultural principles, deviations from cultural values are quickly identified and flagged. For example, in an environment where it was a cultural practice to respond to emails quickly, I rapidly heard about a new executive who was flaky on email and could quickly give feedback; in an environment that values “default to no” hiring, the team pushes back when a manager tries to make compromise hires. The antibodies are extremely valuable to make people flag and take action to course correct problems. In order to maintain cultural antibodies, you need a critical mass of true believers, and you also need to ensure that this group doesn’t burn out — if there are too many deviations, they will stop fighting. So to get there, you need to initially “sweat the small things” — and champion fixing the minor broken windows. If you do this successfully, it empowers the antibodies that create a positive feedback cycle on culture. Principle 8: Write down what makes culture distinctive. Evangelize these points and fight to keep them alive as long as it makes sense for your strategy. Too often, cultural value documents are platitudes that everyone agrees on. What’s most powerful for cultural value documents is a set of principles that make you distinctive . These should be distinctive features of the company that you aspire to scale, and they should be guiding principles to the team in moments of tradeoffs. For example, a value like “We celebrate success as a team” is not especially helpful (even if it’s a good thing to do); it’s not distinctive, and there are rarely situations where it truly guides behavior. Instead, a value like “We focus on promoting from within wherever possible” can be a very distinctive position for a company, and one that can guide decisions during real tradeoffs. Similarly, we thought a lot about what made us distinctive for talent. There are many great companies on lots of different dimensions that candidates care about (ranging from compensation to prestige to balance to impact); we realized that we could be okay at lots of those dimensions, but we could uniquely aspire to be the best place in the world for personal growth . That became a facet of our culture we doubled down on, and a type of candidate we aimed to attract. By writing down the distinctive portions of a culture, it amplifies the things that make you exceptional, and helps to empower the antibodies. Principle 9: Stay lean as much as possible. While leanness is currently popular for financial reasons , I believe it’s even more important for cultural reasons . Everything about culture is easier with a smaller team than a larger team: communication is easier, keeping a high talent bar is easier, and cultivating true believers is easier. I believe that a high-performing team of 500 people usually only has ~2x the output of a high-performing team of 50 people; complexity scales exponentially with team size. As a result, it’s worth it to hire an expensive high-performer who can do the work of 1.5 medium performers; it’s worth it to fight harder to standardize and automate; and it’s worth it to push back on unnecessary hiring; it’s worth it to push the team on how to accomplish more with less. Principle 10: Devote energy to reprogramming external hires. With distinctive cultural values and practices, your organization can become too internally-focused, and not bring in senior complimentary influences from the outside world. You want to make sure that you hire well externally, but senior external hires always come with cultural baggage and ways they’ve done business in the past. It’s worth spending the time with new hires to actively coach them towards the distinctive aspects of your culture, and “reprogram” them on key dimensions; you can walk them through what makes your culture distinctive out of the gate, you can use a 90-day structured feedback session, and you can frequently give micro-coaching in 1:1’s. Bringing in outside perspectives unlocks much greater performance, but you need to make sure you aren’t sacrificing what makes you distinctive in the process. Principle 11: Distinctive culture unlocks distinctive strategy. As you build a distinctive culture, there are types of opportunities that your company becomes uniquely good at seizing. For example, by obsessing over velocity at Datavant, we knew that we could move at 2–10x the pace of most other companies, and we made product, marketing, and sales strategy decisions with that assumption in mind. For example, we built our entire initial marketing strategy around trying to put on the best conference of thought leaders in healthcare; while this wasn’t an especially novel idea, we were simply able to out-execute others and make it happen in a way most companies couldn’t. So based on our strategic decisions around culture, we established competitive advantages that informed our marketing strategy decisions downstream. By developing strengths as an organization, you can then build a strategy that caters to those strengths — and out-execute on a variety of dimensions. Principle 12: Evolve intentionally. The culture that was successful for one stage of growth may not be the same culture that is critical for the next phase of growth. While velocity is a valuable objective across stages, underlying tactics may change over time, especially when undergoing a major change. For example, in shifting from one product to multiple products, in trying to put more emphasis on profitability over growth, in trying to integrate after M&A, or in trying to go more enterprise / international / new market, some of the existing practices may no longer be right for the next stage. On some frequency, it’s worth questioning what cultural practices are still accelerants for your go-forward strategy — and evolving intentionally."
The Six Moats of Data Businesses,https://travismay.medium.com/the-six-moats-of-data-businesses-01a69638c8f8?source=rss-519ecefb7852------2,"There are thousands of data businesses across industries, across a complex value chain. Some companies advertise that they curate data better than others, some advertise that they have exclusive access to X data set, some advertise that they offer the best analytics, and some advertise that they are the easiest to use. The vast majority of these businesses do not go on to become large successes — even if they execute well and build a great data set — because they do not have a defensible moat. This post walks through the different moats that exist in data businesses — and how a few dozen companies found defensibility and became $1+ billion data businesses over time. Features That Aren’t Moats Before jumping into what moats exist, I’ll outline some features that companies focus on that are not defensible: Better curation/quality/coverage/etc. Data that is easier to use (great API, easy pricing, better formatting, etc.) Speed of data collection Better analytics Dashboards & UIs All of these may improve the customer’s experience, and they may be very useful features — but they are not defensible enough to create a large business around (despite hundreds of companies trying to use these to differentiate). Ideally, companies may use some of these features to smooth their sales cycles on their paths to establishing a moat, but these are not sufficient themselves as they are easily replicable. The Most Effective Moat: Data Currencies Almost every data business that is a $1+ billion enterprise has a data currency aspect to its model. A data currency is used by two (or more) parties that rely on a particular data set to complete a transaction; meanwhile the data company that controls the currency takes a tax on its use. Once established, these businesses have massive network effects: the existence of the currency unlocks a large number of transactions, and it is difficult for any company to stop using the currency, because that’s what everyone else is using. Examples of $1+ billion companies that have become data currencies: D&B — the DUNS number is routinely used as the identifier for businesses between a variety of parties, establish a currency that is controlled by D&B Fair Isaac — the FICO score is used as a currency between borrowers and financial institutions to help determine eligibility for a loan Standard & Poor’s –S&P and other ratings agencies create a score used by third parties to determine the creditworthiness of companies, shaping their contracts with lenders Nielsen — when Nordstrom buys a TV ad from NBC, the contract requires that X million viewers see the ad. Nordstrom and NBC don’t know how many viewers saw the ad directly, so Nielsen is used to adjudicate the contract. Datavant — the Datavant key is used between parties in healthcare as a common patient identifier, so two parties know if they have information about the same patient IQVIA — IQVIA benchmarks are used for performance measurement and performance guarantees between product manufacturers and their sales & marketing channels LiveRamp — when two parties in the marketing industry want to exchange data about a consumer, they use LiveRamp IDs as the unique identifier If a company can become a currency, this is by far the most defensible business model in data — as it creates a sticky, multi-sided network. As a result, many of the biggest companies in data have this as a foundational component of their business model. Moat #2: Navigating the long-tail Another approach that can create large data businesses is navigating the long-tail of relationships. In these business models, a company focuses on a large investment in making thousands of partnerships and integrating data across them, and bets that it does not make economic sense for a second company to attempt to replicate that work once they have become an incumbent. The primary risk in this business model: if a large portion of value can be captured with just a handful of relationships, the defensibility only applies to the value of the long-tail portion. Long-tail aggregators should assume that they’ll be disintermediated at the top of the market, and need to ensure there’s still a big enough prize if their moat only protects the long tail. Some examples of multi-billion dollar companies built on this moat: Lexis Nexis built infrastructure to pull data from thousands of local governments and courthouses, aggregating legal records and public information about individuals Plaid has built hundreds of technical integrations with financial services institutions, making it easier for data to flow through its pipes versus building a company’s own pipes Bloomberg has built its position as the largest data vendor to investors because of the comprehensiveness of its data — making the long-tail of information available through its terminals Change Healthcare became a “data clearinghouse” in healthcare, managing the many-to-many data flow between thousands of providers and hundreds of payers Proprietary Data Moats Many companies aim to have proprietary, differentiated data. While this can work as a short-term strategy, it is usually difficult to build a moat around. Typically there are substitutes to the data that exist, so gaining enough proprietary data that another aggregator can’t do the same is difficult. This section will walk through various models of building a proprietary data set that can be defensible, and their pitfalls. Moat #3: Proprietary Data from Exclusive Sources One approach is for a data aggregator to create exclusive relationships with data originators. This is difficult: if the aggregator proves that the data is valuable, the data sources generally try to capture the value (rather than allowing the aggregator to do so); as a result, it works best in industries without a single dominant data source where no individual party has enough market power to extract concessions from the aggregator. There are a few examples of this: IQVIA established its initial dominance in healthcare by signing long-term exclusive relationships to obtain data rights from most major pharmacies (and then augmented this position by becoming a currency). No individual pharmacy had enough market power to disintermediate them, and the long-term nature of their contracts made it difficult for other aggregators to come into the picture. Neustar built its business on top of a decades-long, government-granted exclusivity on the “Number Portability Administration Center” (NPAC) dataset. The NPAC data set tells telco companies which carrier manages a particular phone number, so is critical for successfully routing calls. While Neustar was able to build a successful business around this, this is also a case study of the pitfalls of exclusive data sources: in 2016, the government issued a new RFP, which was fiercely competitive as other companies saw Neustar’s profitability, and Neustar ultimately lost the rights to the data set. Moat #4: Proprietary Data from Give-to-Get Models Another approach to proprietary data is “give-to-get” models: companies have to share data, and in return they get access to data that has been shared with them. There are a number of industry-specific benchmarking tools and “data coops” that follow this model, and a handful of $1+ billion companies: Credit Bureaus ( Experian, Equifax, Transunion ) all have business models where lenders are required to share with them information about defaults and payments, and that information is aggregated and made available to inform credit ratings Tegus makes transcripts of expert interviews available to other Teagus members, so each interview enhances Teagus’ data asset Glassdoor requires employees to provide salary data and feedback on their employers, and then they can research feedback and salaries at other companies Moat #5: Proprietary Data Creation Another approach is proprietary data creation. This is also a risky model — as other companies can often create similar data assets and make similar investments — but there are several examples of proprietary data assets that have stood the test of time: Nielsen has a panel to understand TV viewing behavior of its members (and has used this to create a currency) Gartner / Forrester / Consumer Reports are examples of expert-generated data. Yelp is an example of user-generated data Moat #6: Proprietary Exhaust Data “Exhaust data” is data that comes from another line of business. While it is a near-impossible strategy to build from scratch, the largest data companies in the world generally employ this strategy. Big tech ( Amazon, Facebook, Google ) all make large amounts of money from data, but the knowledge they have comes as exhaust from the “core” products they offer consumers. Many retail companies ( Walmart, CVS, Target, etc. ) have built media networks and data businesses utilizing their knowledge of who is buying products and monetizing that for CPG companies. Flatiron Health is a great example of a company built around secondary use of data. Flatiron built one of the first large businesses around oncology data. In order to aggregate oncology data, they own an Electronic Medical Record system for oncology practices, which is essentially a loss-leader to obtain data rights. *** Data businesses are fiercely competitive, both with other data aggregators, but also with the other players in the value chain (such as the data sources), so moats are foundational to building a large data business. In fact, many of the best data businesses employ multiple of these moats and have several layers of defensibility. In the decade ahead, there will be dozens more $1+ billion data businesses created, and thousands more created that won’t hit that level of success. The ones that succeed won’t just be the companies with the most comprehensive data or the most curation, but they’ll also require thoughtful strategies designed around strong network effects."
Introducing Shaper Capital,https://travismay.medium.com/introducing-shaper-capital-da539284c615?source=rss-519ecefb7852------2,"Over the coming months, I plan to announce several companies focused on solving data fragmentation in various industries, drawing on the playbook and lessons learned from my experiences building LiveRamp and Datavant. Shaper Capital will be the holding company for these businesses and will help to launch and build each venture. This post dives deeper into Shaper Capital, and my motivation for starting it. The Shaper Capital Mission. Shaperism is the belief that individuals can shape the world for the better. Too many people are too quick to accept perceived constraints and don’t deeply believe they can change the world; they view outcomes as luck or destiny. Yet much of the world we live in was built by shapers who believed in exceptionalism and believed that they could change the future — and worked relentlessly to shape it. Our mission is to build companies that shape the world. We do this by finding exceptional talent and cultivating individual shapers, and working with that talent to build businesses that can transform industries. We focus on building businesses in industries we understand well (i.e. data and middleware businesses) where we have a playbook that can defy the odds. Over the next 10 years, our aspiration is to build at least 50 companies that transform industries. Why Start Shaper Capital In launching Shaper Capital, I have three driving hypotheses: Hypothesis 1 — This is the best time ever to start a company. More than ever before, there are a number of “obvious ideas” — whitespace that somebody will capture in the next 5–10 years — that come down to execution. This is because of underlying industry changes (most notably, AI) that create opportunities that markets haven’t solved yet. The abundance of ideas couples with an abundance of talent; in the last decade, the number of talented people who have decided to focus on engineering and decided to work on early-stage companies has taken off. Now that markets have corrected, there is less “noise” in the market from ineffective companies, and an abundance of great talent eager to work on big challenges. Relatedly, many of the biggest challenges and opportunities facing the world today can be addressed by startups. From curing diseases to improving education, from reimagining energy to reducing car accidents, many of the most important problems of our time are being addressed at least partially by technology. The positive feedback cycles in capitalism allow exponential impact for ambitious shapers who focus on businesses that matter for the world. I believe that my greatest impact can come in the form of creating businesses that matter. Hypothesis 2 — Businesses that solve data fragmentation challenges are needed in every industry. In addition to being a great time to start a company in general, this is an especially great time to build “middleware” businesses. Middleware businesses are platforms that help connect an organization’s data and applications to work together interoperably. Middleware businesses thrive when: i) data is extremely valuable, ii) data is extremely fragmented, and iii) applications using data are extremely fragmented. In an age of AI, all three of these conditions are more true than ever — creating more and more value for companies that can help organizations navigate this complexity. I expect nearly every industry will generate a $1+ billion middleware company this decade (and some substantially bigger). Hypothesis 3 — The playbook I’ve built from the Datavant and LiveRamp experiences can scale. LiveRamp is a middleware business that solves data fragmentation in marketing. Datavant is a middleware business that solves data fragmentation in healthcare. Aspects of this playbook are replicable across industries to solve data fragmentation problems. There are high-level take-aways that I learned from my experience leading LiveRamp and from founding and leading Datavant , ranging from: how to obsess over talent & culture from the early days (and win on execution) how to create a reputation for neutrality and trust as an industry utility how to build a land & expand engine and focus the team on relentlessly building a network effect how to obsess over delivery and make sure customers are delighted while you build a culture of automation/productization how to build a partnership-centric business that focuses on win-wins how to create clarity of vision and cultivate true believers (both internally and externally) how to grow inorganically as a startup etc. But so many of the take-aways are frameworks that help with micro-decisions — pattern matching for challenges that have come up in multiple contexts. These takeaways make me a better CEO today than I was in the early days of Datavant, and at Datavant I was a better leader than I was at LiveRamp. With Shaper Capital, a big part of my goal is to get leverage behind this playbook — and apply it at scale across similar business models. I plan to do this by building a lean central company-building engine and personally going deep on several businesses simultaneously, while empowering incredible founder-CEO’s who are all-in on each business. The Shaper Capital Model Our model is to co-found businesses with great CEOs. These businesses are focused on playbooks that we understand well — generally solving data fragmentation challenges in various industries — with an opportunity to transform an industry. We actively help the CEO build the business and play a close role in building the company. We are operating with the following guiding principles: We obsess over talent. We aim to be the best place in the world for a CEO to accelerate their odds of success, for people with entrepreneurial ambitions to become a CEO or join a founding team, and for high-capacity individuals to find roles where they can rapidly grow while delivering impact. We will actively recruit within Shaper Capital and help our companies become talent magnets. We stack the deck for high-probability & high-expected-value outcomes. It’s a myth that startups have a low-probability of success. With the right team and the right initial decisions, a great entrepreneur can almost always get a good outcome while shooting for an exceptional outcome. We will help stack the team and playbook to help change the odds for founders. And we will only build businesses where we believe we can change the odds because of our relationships and playbook (eg. data & middleware!). We will build a long-term reputation of win-win-wins. We will build a brand where i) we are the best place in the world for aspiring entrepreneurs to build companies (by increasing their odds of success, accelerating the path to success, and increasing expected value), ii) we are the best place in the world for great talent to join the best companies (by creating a high personal growth environment), and iii) we are exceptional partners for investors and acquirers to work with (by consistently generating high-quality companies). We only back companies we can shape. Rather than take a large number of small stakes, we will focus on shaping companies where we can own large/majority stakes — and play an active role in working with the CEO (or co-found the company with the CEO ourselves). We do not make passive investments. We continue to invest and stay involved throughout the company’s journey. We are not a partnership or a fund. Most funds have dynamics of partners convincing other partners of their decisions, and make slow (and risk-averse) decisions. We will have a CEO and operate at the pace of a business, not a partnership. Funds also need to spend effort focused on investor relations with LPs, and too many decisions are based on optics and short-termism. Instead, we will operate primarily with personal capital, allowing us to move quickly and focus on long-term results. Come Join Us! We’ll be announcing our first few businesses in the coming months, and we are hiring shapers across these companies — ranging from software engineers and product managers to potential CEOs.

A Startup’s Guide to Buying Companies,https://travismay.medium.com/a-startups-guide-to-buying-companies-c7b603a8e62b?source=rss-519ecefb7852------2,"This is a guide for pre-IPO tech CEOs for when and how to acquire companies. Many thanks to Bob Borek, Dave Eisenberg, Tyler Finkelstein, Auren Hoffman, Shahir Kassam-Adams, Pete McCabe, Tal Rosenberg, Bobby Samuels, and Jim Williamson for their suggestions and edits putting this together. Early in my startup journey, M&A was not a part of the toolkit I ever considered. I suspect this is true for most startup founders: buying a company seems prohibitively expensive and complex, and there is very little playbook for how to do a deal. Only after LiveRamp became a public company did I really begin to understand the toolkit: we had the balance sheet and the ambitions where we made several successful deals. When I went back into the early-stage world, I brought this toolkit with me — and have now led 15 transactions (3 on the sell-side, and 12 on the buy-side) ranging from 6-figure to 10-figure deals. I credit the toolkit with accelerating Datavant’s path by several years, and helping us very quickly establish product-market fit and build scale. I’ve tried to summarize the lessons that I’ve learned on the buy-side below, and will walk through: Why most M&A fails The four types of deals Five prerequisites to considering M&A as a strategy The playbook: Executing the deal process The playbook: Defaulting to no and debating the deal internally The playbook: Structuring the deal The playbook: Pre-planning the integration Why Most M&A Fails While I believe that well-executed M&A can be a very valuable part of a toolkit, it’s important to recognize that most acquisitions made by most companies are poor decisions. M&A hypotheses are usually presented as a “1+1=5” scenario; you put together two companies, have some “synergies,” and suddenly the combined business is worth more than either business standalone. In the vast majority of cases, this is overoptimistic. It’s helpful to think about this equation: Value of Combined Business = Value of Acquirer + Value of Acquiree + Synergies — Dis-synergies There are two very common mistakes that buyers make: Over-optimism on synergies. It’s easy to imagine how everything can go right in a deal, without thinking through how hard it is to execute. The best way to solve this is usually to i) have a base case and a stretch case plan (and make sure the deal makes sense in the base case, and is a home run in the stretch case) and ii) make sure that executives on your team sign up for the numbers. It’s shocking how frequently deals happen with revenue targets that the head of sales doesn’t sign off on, for example. Not acknowledging the dis-synergies. Every deal has dis-synergies; these are usually: distracting the teams (both the deal process & the integration are major distractions for both companies), culture mismatch or culture dilution, reducing the acquiree’s incentives and/or sense of mission, and increased organizational & technical complexity. Under the right circumstances and well managed, these dis-synergies might create an “Integration Tax” of 10–20% — slowing down the business by that amount. But it can also be 100% if not well managed. As a result, instead of “1+1=5”, many deals end up “1+1 = 1.5” (or even “1+1=0.8”). So it is critical to: i) understand the dis-synergies ahead of time, ii) create a plan to minimize them (and obsess over this post-transaction), and iii) make sure that a deal is still valuable even in the scenario of a base case success + some dis-synergies. The Four Types of Deals Often, when making the case for an acquisition, a variety of rationales are presented. It’s usually helpful to put the deal into a single bucket — everything from deal structure to integration approach depends on which bucket you put the business in. There are four types of deals that I’ve seen successfully executed: Buying a team. This is usually a simple deal & integration, where you’re effectively hiring a team. I’ve seen this work successfully with very small businesses (1–5 employees), and also businesses that get you expertise in a new market (for example, we built Datavant’s public sector strategy via an acquisition of a team who understood how to sell to the government). The main considerations in this kind of deal are: i) is the entire team up to your talent bar, ii) making sure everyone on the team wants to join and is bought into the mission/culture/roles, and iii) avoiding internal compensation disparities between an acquired team and your pre-existing team. Once you make the acquisition, you’ll also often think through whether you want them to continue to operate as a group or split across the organization. Buying a product. This is usually the trickiest type of deal, and often looks good on paper but rarely works. In this scenario, you’re buying a product that you believe you can bring to market more effectively than the acquiree — but you’re not in love with the acquiree’s business model, team, and standalone traction. I’ve seen it work in cases where it’s an adjacency to your core business (for example, expanding into a major new product line) with substantial customer overlap but without much technical overlap. But you will need to consider i) whether you will ultimately need to rebuild the product in your own architecture/stack, and ii) why your team will be able to sell it better than the acquiree standalone. These two points usually make the synergy/dyssynergy balance come out strongly against this type of deal. Buying a set of customers. This is a move where you believe that your product can quickly gain share by applying it to an acquiree’s base of customers. I’ve seen this play work most successfully in high network effect businesses. To pull this off successfully, you need to think through customer-by-customer what their reaction will be (and obsess over your messaging), how you will manage feature gaps that inevitably exist, and how long you’re willing to run two products in parallel. Buying a business. The biggest acquisitions are when you are acquiring the whole package — you like the team, the product, and the existing market traction PLUS you believe that you can grow faster together. These are the most expensive deals (there’s a great company on the other side), and usually the highest upside. The key considerations here are around how to actually drive synergies while maintaining the “magic” that makes the acquiree’s business fire on all cylinders. Facebook + Instagram or Google + DoubleClick are probably the canonical examples of this type of deal (and there are thousands of failed examples where the magic was lost). Clarifying the bucket upfront is extremely valuable — and will give clarity to the entire deal team and the acquiree on what’s important and what to expect. Finally, in my experience, rationales that are not on this list generally don’t work (for example, “because it’s distressed/cheap,” “because otherwise they’ll compete with us,” “because we need to grow faster,” “because if we don’t buy them Company X will,” etc.). Five Prerequisites to Consider M&A as a Strategy I don’t believe you need to be over a certain size to consider M&A (or that you must consider M&A over a certain size). Instead, I think there are a few prerequisites to be ready to consider M&A as a company: Extreme clarity on your vision & strategy. M&A can work very well as an accelerant to a well-defined strategy. It is extremely distracting if your strategy is poorly defined, as you will chase ideas that are non-core and be too slow to disqualify shiny objects. Clarity that this is a top priority. For your first deal to be successful, you need to make a deal & integration a top-3 priority of the CEO for 2+ quarters. If the opportunity doesn’t rise to that level, it’s not worth pursuing. Ability to have one of your top performers put everything down and focus on the deal. I’ll talk more about the role of the “Deal Quarterback” below, but you will need a superstar focused exclusively on making the deal & integration going successfully. If you can’t spare that from other priorities, it’s not worth pursuing M&A. Ability to manage legal counsel well. The speed of the deal will most likely be determined by legal negotiations; you need to hire external counsel and be ready to project manage the deal closely. An exceptional CFO and/or deep fluency in your numbers . Deals are complexifiers for finance teams; you will need someone great thinking through the details and mechanics. On the other hand, a large balance sheet isn’t critical (you can structure equity deals and earnout-based deals if there’s truly a 1+1=5 scenario). The Playbook: Executing the deal process Once you begin to get conviction in a hypothesis, you’ll want to optimize for speed+quality deal execution. Because M&A is generally a massive distraction for both businesses, speed & decisiveness are critical to not lose business momentum. You will have a team of advisors who believe you should negotiate more, spend more time being thorough on understanding risk, and maintain optionality on aspects of the deal; a big part of your job is to champion velocity over these concerns. At many companies, deals can take a 3–6+ month timeline. This has always struck me as slow, and part of your job as CEO is to cut through the noise to speed it up. At LiveRamp, we acquired two companies for ~$200 mm. in a 2-week period; speed is just a matter of prioritization and strategic clarity. This is the rough playbook I’ve followed: Step 1: Build a close relationship with the acquiree CEO. Selling a company is a deeply emotional decision and an exhausting process, and when the deal finally closes you need the CEO to lead their team through the complexity of integration. It’s valuable to earn as much trust as possible early in the process; then throughout the process you’ll want to check in to ensure you and the acquiree CEO feel like you are on the same team and excited about the same vision, rather than opposing teams. Step 2: Assign a “Deal Quarterback” who is full-time on the deal, and create a “Deal Team.” The best Deal Quarterbacks I’ve worked with are hungry generalists who may be thinking about M&A for the first time, but are able to grasp the cross-functional complexity of a deal and project manage phenomenally well. The Deal Team should generally include the Deal Quarterback, the executive(s) who are going to be accountable for the success of the deal (usually the “Deal Champion”), plus finance/legal resources as necessary. If you aren’t ready to designate a superstar Deal Quarterback to drop their other work entirely, and if there’s not a strong “Deal Champion” who sees the deal as a key priority, it’s not worth pursuing a deal. Step 3: Tell the acquiree CEO you’re interested in buying them. Being direct is helpful, and this is often easiest over a dinner when possible. You want to paint the vision for them and get them excited about joining forces, and you want to find out i) if they’re interested, ii) what matters most to them in a deal (autonomy, financials, team success, pushing a mission forward, etc.), and iii) general level of alignment on strategy. If they are generally aligned, work out an aggressive timeline with them for how to get to a go/no-go (both sides will want to move quickly); this will both increase the probability of a deal happening and help to create momentum for the deal happening quickly. Step 4: Write down your hypothesis for why the deal makes sense, a pre-mortem of why an acquisition succeeds and why it fails, and what open questions you have. Share this with your Deal Team and the acquiree CEO. Honing a brief deal memo with a very crisp thesis is helpful for clarifying your thoughts, and aligning everyone’s thinking about the deal. You want to know if the acquiree CEO agrees with your hypothesis and the risks. This is also where you’ll begin to articulate a value framework for what needs to be true for a deal to make sense financially. Step 5: Get a “101 Management Presentation” from the acquiree CEO to your Deal Team. This should be a basic overview of the business as they would tell their story. Use it to build high-level familiarity for everyone on the deal team, and also to hear how they frame the opportunity. Step 6: Have a real debate within your Deal Team. More on the mechanics of this debate below, but this is a good time to kill a deal where you don’t have extreme conviction; the volume of work is about to explode if you proceed further. Step 7: Work with the acquiree CEO to answer questions that block a “Letter of Intent.” This should be a fairly narrow list: i) answer the “open questions” that are critical to answer to understand whether the fundamental deal rationale works, ii) answer questions required for determining valuation/deal structure (for example, income statement, balance sheet, cap table), and iii) understand the acquiree’s high-level requirements on what it would take financially to get a deal done. Many companies look for too much immaterial detail at this stage; in practice, you’re really trying to understand whether your core hypothesis makes sense, not everything about the acquiree (during diligence, you’ll have an opportunity to confirm the details — right now you’re just trying to confirm the core thesis) Step 8: Negotiate and sign a Letter of Intent. The LOI is usually 2–6 pages, is non-binding, and covers the high level deal terms. Ideally, you front-load as much of the negotiation to this step as possible, as this is the key moment to align on what the deal should look like. You also want to be fairly certain that you want to move forward once you’re at this point (assuming nothing surprising comes up in diligence). Like any major negotiation, your goal in negotiating is to understand what motivates the seller (and what are non-starters), understand and articulate what motivates you, and find positive-sum ways to bridge those gaps. While there are a few zero-sum points in a deal, there are a lot of variables in play (amount of payout to shareholders, certainty of payout, level of control, outcome for employees, what happens when key employees leave, etc.); this means there are many points that one side or the other might care a lot more about and usually pretty reasonable compromises to be made. Step 9: Run 3 workstreams in parallel, with an aggressive calendar: Deal execution. In this workstream, your goal is to manage the process (and manage lawyers) to move the deal forward as quickly as possible and avoid the thousand minor details getting in the way of the big picture and key terms [more on this below]. There will ultimately be a 50–100+ page contract that goes with the deal, and 50–100 pages of “ancillary agreements” — so the complexity is very real, but can still be navigated swiftly. Diligence. In this workstream, you are trying to figure out show-stoppers . These depend on what you’re acquiring (Team, Product, Customer List, or Business). For example, a single low-performer might be a show-stopper if your goal is to acquire a team, but probably isn’t if you’re acquiring a business; similarly, lots of churn may be an issue if you’re acquiring a business, but not necessarily if you’re acquiring a team and plan to shutter the product. The main mistake companies make here is asking generic questions and not defining upfront what is a show-stopper based on the deal. Integration/Day 1 Plan. This is the most important workstream, and for many companies the most poorly run. You want to set up the momentum to hit the ground running immediately when the deal is announced/closed. More on this below. Note that these three workstreams all need to move in parallel, and are all complex. They are also interrelated: you may decide to add incentives to the deal based on some of the day 1 plans, or you may find an intellectual property risk in diligence that you need to protect yourself from in the deal. So having a tight Deal Team, a superstar Deal Quarterback, and daily standups are important. Step 10: Turn everything you learn into a final deal memo, and have a final debate. There’s a lot of momentum at this point in favor of the deal, but it’s important to still step back before you make a final decision and give yourself another chance to get to no based on what you’ve learned. Step 11: Sign the deal, announce, close, and get started! In most <$100 mm deals, this can all happen the same day; in larger deals or more complex deals, there may be weeks or months between signing and closing. After you sign, make your first call to the acquiree CEO to congratulate them. It’s a big day for them, and the emotions are always bittersweet — and you need them engaged for the next leg of the journey. Step 12: Keep the deal team focused on the integration & early success. Remember that closing an acquisition is the starting line , not the finish line . Now you need to relentlessly make it successful, keep the team’s focus, and continue the project management discipline throughout the integration. Things to do in parallel with all of the above… Consistent debate. Have the deal team constantly decide if they still champion a deal in light of information coming in. Every day, you’ll get more information that will build or diminish conviction — both on the details of the business, as well as subtle things like cultural fit, attitude, responsiveness, and trustworthiness. Try to break the pattern of defaulting to yes once deal momentum kicks in. Navigate your internal stakeholders. Depending on your Board dynamics, make sure they’re able to move at your pace. If you have organizational puzzles associated with the deal, make sure you’re getting ahead of it. Ensure the Deal Champion is project managing tightly. Good M&A (and integrations) have the most complex project management I’ve ever seen. A good Google Sheet (with clear tasks/owners/deadlines) & daily progress email is critical to maintain public accountability and disseminate information to your deal team. Bring on vendors and get them briefed. In particular, almost every startup will use external legal counsel…you’ll want them up-to-speed before you start the LOI process. Keep a great relationship with the CEO and ensure they are excited. This can get lost in the thousands of details and you limp across the finish line feeling like adversaries rather than teammates. The playbook: Defaulting to no and debating the deal internally Because i) most deals fail and ii) you’re gaining information throughout the deal process, it’s incredibly important to facilitate good debates within your team on whether a deal should happen. I’ve generally run this as: Focus on the question of “If this company were free, would we buy it and make integration a top 3 corporate priority?” People can get distracted by whether it’s a “good deal,” but fundamentally, feedback from the full team is most helpful on is whether it’s a net major accelerant to your strategy, or a net decelerator. (Most deals that I’ve seen companies do either have 3–100x return, or 0-to-negative return — rarely does price matter much on the fundamental decision). Begin each “debate” meeting with everyone doing “Thumbs Up” if they are a champion, “Thumbs Slightly Up” if they like it but don’t champion, “Thumbs Slightly Down” if they don’t like it but are persuadable, and “Thumbs Down” if they’re a “veto.” Get the champions and detractors speaking up to push debate (and play devil’s advocate if nobody takes the other side) To do a deal, ultimately, after lots of debates, the person who owns the number needs to champion it, I (as CEO) need to champion it, and I need to make sure nobody is a veto. Everyone else is just an input to the decision-making process, but not a decision maker. Killing deals quickly is important, as low-conviction opportunities can linger for a long time, adding distraction to the business. If there isn’t a champion, it doesn’t make sense to pursue…even if it might be interesting. The Playbook: Structuring the deal There are lots of permutations to how deals can be structured, and in general , if a deal is truly 1+1=5 –there’s always a way to structure it where it’s win-win. At a high level, there are 4 main currencies at play in a deal: Guaranteed cash. In general, sellers will often optimize for cash because of its certainty, and at a minimum will want to see substantial skin in the game from you. However, cash is most likely the currency that you have the most real constraints around, and cashing out the seller reduces their incentives for the future. Guaranteed equity in your company. Equity helps to align incentives. The main challenge with equity for private companies is that it has an “unknown” value; if you’re close to a fundraise round, you may be able to piggyback on that round’s valuation, but otherwise you’ll be debating how to value it. That said, it’s usually good to have at least some equity in a deal for go-forward employees. Time-based retention incentives (cash or stock). This encourages go-forward employees to stay at the company, and is usually structured over 2–4 years. Performance-based “earnout” incentives (cash or stock) . These can be extremely effective at bridging a valuation, as they pay out based on an outcome that you define upfront. For example, you could agree to pay out $50 mm ONLY IF a new product line drives at least $10 mm of revenue. However, you will quickly need to negotiate how exactly to measure performance, and how much autonomy the team has to achieve the goal (What if you want to shut down the product in two years because your strategy changed? What if the sales team doesn’t drive leads? Etc.). Moreover, this restricts your degrees of freedom in the future: what if the acquired company has a superstar who you want to take on a broader role, but they are needed in their current role for the team to maximize their odds of hitting their earnout? I’ve found that most earnouts I’ve structured are often renegotiated a year later, but that the initial earnout structure was a great way to bridge a gap to get a deal done and clarify “what matters most” in an integration. Many deals have a mix of all four of these mechanics, and the right structure is dependent on what you’re trying to accomplish (if you’re buying a team, time-based retention is helpful; if you’re buying a business, earnouts are helpful), as well as what the acquiree is trying to accomplish (How risk tolerant are they? How much leverage do they have in the negotiation?). There are a lot of terms in most M&A that don’t matter much, and part of your job as CEO is to keep the focus on the core terms and not let the deal become too complex. A good example is escrows; frequently, there’s an escrow for ~10% of the deal value, and a huge amount of negotiation goes into the mechanics around it (as well as a large amount of emotion for sellers). The reality is I’ve never seen these used in a material way, and so I usually just eliminate this mechanic from deals to simplify the structure. However, there are two seemingly “small” terms that will matter a lot: Tax structure — small changes in the deal may impact whether the acquiree has to pay income tax or capital gains Treatment of employee stock — typically, the amount of stock outside the leadership team is small as a percentage of the deal value — but you want to be extremely careful to treat employees you’re acquiring well (assuming you want to retain them). There are complex mechanics around unvested stock and option treatment that come up in every deal. Overall, the key is to approach the negotiation as a “win-win,” looking for how to turn a 1+1=5 deal premise into a deal where both companies feel like they got a great return. The Playbook: Pre-planning the integration Ultimately, the thing that makes or breaks a deal is execution. The reason most deals fail is because they are executed poorly: integrations are complex, and require you to make it one of your top personal priorities to maximize synergy and minimize dis-synergy. Integrations can take a number of different forms, and they depend on your business objectives. If you’re acquiring a team, you probably want to quickly shutter the acquiree’s products, revamp the org chart on day 1, and harmonize tech stack, culture, compensation, and a number of other internal cadences. On the flipside, if you’re buying a large thriving company and trying to accelerate it, you may choose to do a “do no harm” approach, allowing the complexity of two different internal teams and cultures while focusing on a small number of key synergy points to focus on. In a well-run deal, you answer many of these questions before the deal signs . This allows you to align employees and customers on the plan when the deal is announced, and maximize momentum when that occurs. It is alsomuch easier to make and communicate hard decisions upfront than it is to make them later. Specifically, before a deal happens, you should answer: What are the most important synergies? Who is accountable for those and how will you track them relentlessly? What is the internal narrative around the acquisition at both companies? You’ll need to articulate the strategy, the culture, go-forward jobs, and the financial outcomes. The Deal Quarterback should put together a detailed project plan for how communications happen, as this is an emotional day that sets the tone for the future. What is the external narrative? You’ll want to brief the sales team of both companies on talking points, personally write the press release/blog post, and spend much of the announcement day calling key customers. In many deals, we designed a minute-by-minute “tick tock plan” of who we call in what sequence in order to control the narrative. What is the acquired CEO’s job and reporting line in the company and scope of role? Is this imminently going to change? Aligning expectations and goals upfront is key. Day 1, be able to tell all employees their go-forward “offer letter” — what is their charter, is their compensation/title changing, how do the deal terms impact them, etc. If there are changes to the org structure happening in the first ~6 months, go ahead and make them day 1. Are you going to consolidate finance teams? Sales teams? Etc. Is the goal to cross-sell? How will the sales motion work and who is accountable for this? Is the goal to consolidate products? Who is accountable for this? Do you want to consolidate brands, tech stacks, hiring processes, etc.? How quickly will you do this, and who will decide and what first principles will guide tradeoffs? If you’re planning to integrate much in the first 6 months, it’s often helpful to do it out of the gate. You’ll want everyone on both teams aligned on those points, clear accountabilities, and the Deal Quarterback and yourself focused on eliminating blockers and championing progress against these goals. In the end, the deal will most likely succeed or fail on those first few months of momentum. *** In this guide, I walked through why deals usually fail, what kinds of deals can succeed, and my playbook for running deals. These have been my biggest takeaways: You can (and should) do a deal 10x faster than “normal” by staying focused on the things that matter most. Default to no — integration is always harder than expected, so a deal needs to be great to make it worth the distraction. Get to no quickly unless you have conviction. Obsess over the integration — that is what makes or breaks a deal. Devise the plan before you sign the deal. Focus on whether a deal is worth the distraction more than focusing on price. Win-win deal structures are always possible with a good deal Assign ownership on the deal and integration early in the process — form a Deal Team and assign a full-time Deal Quarterback early. Write down a deal memo to make the hypothesis as crisp as possible, debate it frequently internally, and share it with the acquiree for discussion. Building the relationship with the acquiree’s CEO is critical — don’t let it become transactional. Even with great M&A, it’s just one tool in the toolkit — and you need to compliment it with a phenomenal organic growth engine."
Lessons from Datavant,https://travismay.medium.com/lessons-from-datavant-472e526a2377?source=rss-519ecefb7852------2,"Last week marked the end of my 5-year tenure leading Datavant (I’ll continue to be on the Board and close to the company in many ways (and very excited about its future!), but will be stepping out of day-to-day operations). Five years ago, we set out with an ambitious goal to “connect the world’s health data.” We had a deep belief that the fragmentation of health data was one of the largest problems facing the world — and that the company that solves it could become immensely valuable. In those 5 years, we’ve made great progress towards this mission, building an ecosystem of several thousand life sciences companies, government agencies, payers, and providers who use Datavant to safely exchange data. Additionally, we’ve built a great business, as we’ve rapidly become one of the largest and fastest-growing healthtech companies in the world — and through our merger with Ciox we’re very well positioned to be the foundation of the health data economy. I’m excited for what the next chapter will bring for the company. As I’ve reflected on the transition, I wanted to list out some of the lessons that I’ve learned through the journey that have made me a better CEO. This is a follow-up and add-on to the “ Lessons from LiveRamp ” post that I made leaving LiveRamp in 2018. These are some of the biggest non-obvious take-aways I have from the Datavant journey so far: Institutionalize time as your enemy. M&A can be an effective growth lever — even for a startup. Even with infinite capital, stay lean. Your leadership bench is everything during hypergrowth. TAM is the most overrated metric in business. Find the win-win-wins. Ensure bad news travels quickly. As CEO, aspire to (almost) never be the decision-maker/owner. Push back on tradeoffs. *** Lesson 1: Institutionalize time as your enemy. When most people think of great companies, we usually think of incredible products and strong moats. Those are great, yet the biggest differentiator for most great companies on the rise is actually company velocity — the ability to sustainably outpace others in the market. Closing the deal a few weeks faster, pushing out the new feature a quarter earlier, and hiring the candidate a week sooner compound as a sustainably faster growth rate — and allow a company to hit “escape velocity” (which creates a virtuous cycle as clients and prospective employees and investors see the company as “hot”). The reality is most successful businesses don’t find success in one stroke of brilliance, but rather in navigating thousands of micro-decisions effectively — so building a machine that allows rapid, high-quality decision-making and execution is a key aspect of company building. Establishing velocity as a core competency needs to be even more intentional as the company scales — by default, it’s much easier to move quickly in a 5 person environment than a 50 person environment, and a 500 person environment over a 5,000 person environment. How do you build this? There is no silver bullet, but a few of the levers we focused on: Hire great people so local decisions can be made well Good transparent communication so local decision-makers are empowered to understand the big picture Clear decision rights, smart org structure, strong alignment on strategy/priorities, and cross-team processes that promote rapid decision-making A culture that values velocity (we wrote the Datavant Way — our culture manifesto — largely focused on velocity; we threw new hires into projects immediately to set a tone; and we assigned pre-readings for new hires like Hustle as a Strategy that make this point). Systematically rewarding execution over ideation and “doers” over “strategists” Personally set the pace as a leader — on small things and on big things. Lesson 2: M&A can be an effective growth lever — even for a startup. Inorganic growth isn’t in most startups’ tool-kits. Most startups grow purely organically, and most VCs see inorganic growth as a signal that the core business model isn’t working. And because it’s not part of the standard playbook, most founders don’t really understand how to successfully buy companies. This was an area where I changed a lot between Datavant and my previous companies; because I had learned how to do M&A successfully when LiveRamp was public, I was able to apply this knowledge forward into building Datavant from the early days — and we obsessed over organic growth, but made some major inorganic moves that helped shape the company’s trajectory. Over my 5 years leading Datavant, we ended up doing ~10 acquisitions — all of which were very accretive in retrospect. Eight of these were tuck-ins — generally bringing in a strong team to help us in a particular area. Two of these were transformational bets that were designed to shave years off of our journey in some way. To be clear, there are many pitfalls of M&A — it can’t be a substitute for organic growth, and it can’t be a “portfolio strategy” substituting for a core business model. Most acquisitions fail over integration, and especially when the culture is being formed, obsessing over how a company combines with your culture is critical. But when the right target exists and the right obsession with the integration details is in place, M&A can be a very effective lever to scale non-linearly. Lesson 3: Even with infinite capital, stay lean. During the boom times, leanness was out of fashion — and it was not uncommon for a low burn rate (or profitability) to be critiqued as not growing fast enough. And now, as raising capital is getting more expensive, there is a rediscovery of the importance of cash flow. This shift in zeitgeist (based on interest rates, valuation multiples, and macro-economic forces) misses the point. Beyond the profitability benefits of leanness , leanness actually helps a company run more quickly and more effectively. By not having free range to hire customer service reps, you’re forced to automate your product — which ultimately makes customers happier. By not having free range to make sales hires, you focus on improving your productivity per rep. By not giving free range to make G&A hires, you force process discipline. And by keeping the team as small as possible, you reduce communication overhead, making it easier to make quick decisions. To be clear, we rapidly grew the team as the business scaled. But throughout the journey, we kept ARR per capita at $300–500K (while growing quickly). Culturally, we sought to ensure that hiring was seen as a failure to automate that should be avoided, not as a source of pride. This leanness has helped us be way ahead of the market as the market turned, but even if the market never turned — the focus on leanness has allowed us to move faster than we otherwise ever could. Lesson 4: Your leadership bench is everything during hypergrowth. In a successful company, there are moments where your product-market fit is so strong, that the #1 thing you’re paying attention to as a leader is “how do we keep hitting the gas but not break.” Companies break from growth in lots of different ways, ranging from literally having product outages, to losing touch with customer needs, to losing the caliber of their team; there are many parables of companies that in retrospect grew too fast. The best way to sustain hypergrowth without breaking is to have a strong leadership bench — people that you can put in 2x or 10x bigger roles and can step up to a variety of challenges. One of the most successful things we did at Datavant was to focus on hiring great generalists and encouraging “tours of duty” across different functions and teams, building a bench of really high-potential individuals who we could tap to jump in opportunistically to key roles. We leaned on this profile for everything from running M&A integrations to standing up new lines of business to running an industry conference. Lesson 5: TAM is the most overrated metric in business. For investors that passed on Datavant in the early days, the #1 reason they chose not to invest was Total Addressable Market (the same was true for LiveRamp in the early days as well). “Linking” and “De-identification” were not large existing markets, so it was tough to articulate with evidence how large the market would be; many folks in the industry speculated estimates as low as $10 mm and as high as $50 mm, which are both well smaller than the business is today. While TAM is a useful metric in established/stable markets, TAM works very poorly as a metric for markets that are being created. Our hypothesis was “There has never been an open data ecosystem before in healthcare; as one gets created, the amount of data exchange will take off” — which has generally proven to be true. The TAM metric also ignores that most great businesses win a specific market, and then use that beachhead to gradually expand and win adjacent markets; companies that focus on TAM usually make the mistake of taking on the whole market simultaneously to try to get 1% share, rather than trying to win 80% share of some niche in the market as a first step. The Facebook story, the Amazon story, and most other great tech successes start from winning ubiquity in a new market niche, and then using that to go after the next market and the next market. Instead of focusing on TAM, companies should focus on winner-take-most business models that solve large needs near large amounts of money . As we created the linking market, we’ve been able to grow the market and focus on more and more adjacent data exchange needs — that have left us with much more room for growth than any TAM analysis has ever shown. Lesson 6: Find the win-win-wins. To build a successful company, there are a lot of stakeholders that matter: shareholders, clients, partners, employees, and the world at large. I believe that many of the best leaders are great at identifying win-win-wins; while we are ultimately a company focused on shareholder returns, we were able to find a high level of alignment across these stakeholders. Win-wins in company vision. One of the great aspects of Datavant is that not only is it a strong business, but I believe its mission is critical for American healthcare. This means that our commercial success is highly correlated with progress for American healthcare, and allowed us to attract academic, policy, and nonprofit partners and advocates for our business, which in turn massively accelerated our commercial success; similarly, we were able to attract people who cared about impacting the world, again ultimately making us more commercially successful. This is not true for all companies, but finding a business model that aligns with social benefit can unlock a faster pace of growth. Win-wins for the ecosystem . We set up a business model where every time a party entered our ecosystem, they became a potential source or consumer of data from other parties in our ecosystem. This meant that our existing clients prospered from our growth — setting up a nice network effect, but also making it so that the majority of our new clients are referred by existing customers. Win-wins between “counterparties.” The best negotiations I’ve ever been involved in weren’t well negotiated because we captured a lot of the value, but rather because we created a lot of value. The best negotiators are good at finding 1 + 1 = 8 opportunities, and negotiating to take ~4, rather than being great at finding 1+1 =2.5 opportunities and negotiating hard to take 1.49. Win-wins with employees . Creating a sense of implicit trust that “we are the best place to grow,” “we will treat you fairly,” and “the company’s success is your success” has been invaluable to getting the highest performers to come work for Datavant and creating an environment for people to go above and beyond. Lesson 7: Ensure bad news travels quickly and is openly discussed . As companies grow, making sure that the right things are communicated to the right people becomes exponentially complex. One of the casualties is usually how bad news gets communicated: well-intentioned people want to solve an issue before it goes to the CEO, avoid just bringing problems and not bringing solutions to leadership, and generally want to avoid looking bad (or making others look bad) by being associated with a problem. That means that — as the company grows — leadership (and the team in general) hears about the victories, but hears less about the challenges facing the business. This takes away a level of customer-centricity for the whole team, and makes the team less nimble in reacting to problems facing the business. The two levers I’ve found that are most effective at combating this: A “red events” escalation process. At Datavant, we have a “red event” email alias, where people on the team are expected to send key issues impacting customers in real-time (and who the owners/what the status is), which automatically notifies key leaders across the company. Part of my job has been to constantly normalize the use of this alias; that it’s not bad to send a red event, but that I would be frustrated if I heard about an issue from a customer that wasn’t first flagged as a red event. For most red events, the email just serves as an FYI — but it helps to flag the issue, create widespread visibility, and rally support when needed. Great “retrospectives.” Blameless, crisp retrospectives whenever something bad occurs are extremely healthy. Again, these don’t occur naturally (and can devolve either into cross-team complaining, or adjacent teams pulling punches to avoid making their co-workers look bad), and need some nudging to get the ritual running effectively — but institutionalizing retrospectives helps turn every issue into an opportunity to improve. Lesson 8: As CEO, aspire to (almost) never be the decision-maker/owner. A key part of a CEO’s job is to create personal leverage: My general attitude is that if I’m required to be the owner of a project or decision-maker on a question, that stems from a failure to create enough leverage, and should be solved by making sure I have the right team that I trust and making sure decision rights are clear. Of course, the reality is that the CEO is always involved in lots of decisions — but I view that as a symptom that should be solved via hiring, coaching, and clarity of strategy + ownership. A CEO should have an opinion and nudge on all kinds of issues, but actually being the decision-maker should be rare. So a key part of the operating cadences I created for the company were ways to i) find spots to add my voice as “influence” — but not as a decision-maker, and ii) manage by random sampling — going deep to understand random areas of the business to ensure that I trust how processes are working. What are the exceptions? Based on my strengths and what I believe are the most important aspects to get right as we scale, I focused on culture, communications, and macro-strategy as the three areas where I consistently wanted to retain decision-making authority, and then I would drive special projects. Lesson 9: Push back on tradeoffs. Many smart people are really good at laying out a constrained optimization, and understanding how more of A requires less of B. This leads to comments like “We should slow down sales until we improve the product”, “Are we willing to trade-off security for ease of use,” or “We need to hire another person if we want to add X initiative.” These are all often very valid comments, and it’s important to listen to them seriously. But often, some of my best moves as CEO were to just reject the premise of a tradeoff. Constraint-driven thinking is right if a company is running at its efficient frontier; the reality is it’s extremely rare for any team to be at an efficient frontier — and more often, the team will rise to the circumstances. So setting the vision for why it’s critical to have A AND B ” is often the right answer when confronted with a tradeoff. Of course, this is only true in some circumstances — and it’s critical sometimes to make tradeoffs. But 80% of the time, my job was to just raise the bar and convince the team that they can rise to the occasion. *** These are just a few of the big takeaways I had that have shaped my leadership outlook. Thank you to the many, many people who have helped me learn these lessons and helped make Datavant come so far so fast — and I’m excited for where the company goes from here. *** Note: these are additional lessons from my most recent chapter, and is intended to be additive to the Lessons from LiveRamp post; many of the lessons there are still the fundamentals of my leadership philosophy."
