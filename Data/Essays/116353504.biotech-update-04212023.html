<p>A cancer in Tasmanian devils that is spread from host to host by biting, something I’ve never heard of before and supposedly very rare in nature.</p><p>“To investigate, Hamede and his colleagues assembled a Tasmanian devil reference genome and compared it with DNA sequenced from 78 DFT1 and 41 DFT2 tumours. The team then constructed ‘family trees’ of these tumours to track their origin and mapped their mutations to build a picture of how the diseases have evolved.”</p><p>By looking at the ecology of this, you can see the cancer’s heritage and how it was passed down and eventually diverging into another tumor variant DFT2. I’m not sure how cancer cells could migrate to another host. <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/the-cancers-that-are-contagious__;!!DZ3fjg!9hLWZ9taaeHFtt-29fK8tuC2qAFfWGmUyHivh0Db76lqbiM0qa5yHrDR2x25MMtKLxX29Ykzkj13WRlVSHLB2fdULU_wkkHDzA$">Here</a> is an example in humans. In past research, using tumor grafts, immune systems have melted away at the tumors, but it seems this is not always the case. I wonder if you could create a therapeutic based this technology to develop a “good cancer”.</p><p><a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01349-7__;!!DZ3fjg!9hLWZ9taaeHFtt-29fK8tuC2qAFfWGmUyHivh0Db76lqbiM0qa5yHrDR2x25MMtKLxX29Ykzkj13WRlVSHLB2fdULU8kgnqL4w$">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01349-7</a></p><p>Kevin Tang is swooping into RMs and attempting to cash out and redeem value to shareholders it seems.

It typically happens in the evening or nighttime hours when you're sitting or lying down. Moving eases the unpleasant feeling temporarily.</p><p>Treatments for restless leg syndrome typically fall into two main categories, according to the Mayo Clinic: prescription medications—including opioids, muscle relaxants and drugs that increase dopamine levels—and external, topical treatments like warm baths, leg massages, foot wraps and more.</p><p>Noctrix Health aims to bridge that gap with a neurostimulation-based approach. Delivered via two bands worn around each leg overnight, the drug-free technology is designed to activate muscles in the legs to help reduce the symptoms and improve sleep quality, since the condition often flares up in the evening and at night, when individuals are sitting or lying down.</p><p>”</p><p><a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/noctrix-healths-neurostim-wearables-restless-leg-syndrome-earn-fda-de-novo-nod__;!!DZ3fjg!9hLWZ9taaeHFtt-29fK8tuC2qAFfWGmUyHivh0Db76lqbiM0qa5yHrDR2x25MMtKLxX29Ykzkj13WRlVSHLB2fdULU8i5xHD3A$">https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/noctrix-healths-neurostim-wearables-restless-leg-syndrome-earn-fda-de-novo-nod</a></p><p>Moderna enlists IBM for Quantum Computing and AI Training</p><p>“Moderna will be able to take advantage of our multi-year research efforts in generative AI for therapeutics that can allow scientists to better understand how molecules behave and may facilitate creating entirely new ones,” said Darío Gil, director of IBM research.”</p><p><a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/moderna-enlists-ibm-quantum-computing-ai-training__;!!DZ3fjg!9hLWZ9taaeHFtt-29fK8tuC2qAFfWGmUyHivh0Db76lqbiM0qa5yHrDR2x25MMtKLxX29Ykzkj13WRlVSHLB2fdULU-kxSniGQ$">https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/moderna-enlists-ibm-quantum-computing-ai-training</a></p><p>Editing the genome of cows’ microbiota to stop methane production</p><p><a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.fiercebiotech.com/research/nobel-laureate-jennifer-doudna-and-colleagues-will-use-crispr-curb-methane-emissions-cows__;!!DZ3fjg!9hLWZ9taaeHFtt-29fK8tuC2qAFfWGmUyHivh0Db76lqbiM0qa5yHrDR2x25MMtKLxX29Ykzkj13WRlVSHLB2fdULU8bkwpa2A$">https://www.fiercebiotech.com/research/nobel-laureate-jennifer-doudna-and-colleagues-will-use-crispr-curb-methane-emissions-cows</a></p><p>Breakthrough in battery density that can enable electrification of passenger aircraft</p><p><a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://thedriven.io/2023/04/21/worlds-largest-battery-maker-announces-major-breakthrough-in-battery-density/__;!!DZ3fjg!9hLWZ9taaeHFtt-29fK8tuC2qAFfWGmUyHivh0Db76lqbiM0qa5yHrDR2x25MMtKLxX29Ykzkj13WRlVSHLB2fdULU-EepcZ2Q$">https://thedriven.io/2023/04/21/worlds-largest-battery-maker-announces-major-breakthrough-in-battery-density/</a></p>
